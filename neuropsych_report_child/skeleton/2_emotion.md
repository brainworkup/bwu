To assess (ref:first-name)'s social-emotional functioning, (ref:he-she) was asked to objectively respond to 175 statements about (ref:his-her) behavior, emotions, thoughts, and perceptions.
Clinical Scales provide an estimate of (ref:first-name)â€™s level of distress in a variety of areas, while Adaptive Scales focus on positive psychological adjustment.

The validity indicators fell in the normal range, suggesting (ref:he-she) answered in a reasonably forthright manner and did not attempt to present an unrealistic or inaccurate impression that was either more negative or more positive than the clinical picture would warrant.
