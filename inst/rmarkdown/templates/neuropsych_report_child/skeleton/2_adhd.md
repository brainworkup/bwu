- Initiation (e.g., beginning tasks or projects on own, including starting tasks easily, being motivated, and taking the initiative when needed)
- Organization (e.g., manage personal effects, work, or multiple tasks, including organizing tasks and thoughts well, managing time effectively, and working neatly)
- Planning (e.g., developing and implementing strategies to accomplish tasks, including planning ahead and making good decisions)
- Self-Monitoring (e.g., evaluating one's own behavior in order to determine when a different approach is necessary, including noticing and fixing mistakes, knowing when help is required, and understanding when a task is completed)
- Working Memory (e.g., keeping information in mind that is important for knowing what to do and how to do it, including remembering important things, instructions, and steps)
