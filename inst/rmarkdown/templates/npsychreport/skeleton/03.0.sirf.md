## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

(ref:first-name) (ref:last-name) is a (ref:age)-year-old (ref:sex) with a history of (ref:dx1) and (ref:dx2).
(ref:he-she-cap) was referred for testing by (ref:his-her) psychiatrist,(ref:refdoc), to assess (ref:his-her) current cognitive and emotional functioning.
Without question, (ref:first-name) is an endearing (ref:sex) who presents with a
multitude of cognitive and interpersonal strengths.
(ref:his-her-cap) premorbid and current general ability/intellectual skills are in the average range for (ref:his-her) age and level of schooling.
Verbal/language processing is intact.
Fluid/spatial reasoning is broadly intact for (ref:his-her) age; scores that are somewhat low in this area are secondary to nonverbal working memory difficulties rather than difficulties with reasoning and problem-solving.
Attentional and executive functioning, including judgment/decision-making, auditory attention, and processing speed are solidly average.
Of note, attentional/executive functioning deficits may not show up on tests or in a structured testing office and yet be evident in real-world settings.
This seems to be the case for (ref:first-name), as (ref:his-her) self-report ratings indicated moderate attention and executive problems in the areas of inattention/working memory difficulties, impulsivity/emotional lability, and on a global indicator of symptoms suggestive of a disorder of executive/attentional functioning.
Learning and long-term memory functioning are intact on exam, with no evidence of memory impairment nor memory disorder.
