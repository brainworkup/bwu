Services (PBHS) clinic on the University Park Campus. (ref:he) attended the
appointments with (ref:his) parents. (ref:he2) was evaluated across
two 4-hour testing sessions scheduled a week apart in a physically-distanced
testing environment. A number of precautionary safety measures were employed

(ref:he2) seemed tired and had somewhat reserved affect. (ref:he2) denied headache but reported a mildly upset stomach. (ref:he2) spoke little outside of responding to test items, but (ref:his) speech was typical for (ref:his) age. (ref:his2) language expression and comprehension were age-appropriate. (ref:he2) was cooperative with testing and seemed motivated to do well. (ref:he2) was friendly but reserved. (ref:his2) affect was somewhat restricted in range and expression but positive, and (ref:he) showed a full range of emotions. Eye contact was good and appropriate to situation. (ref:he2) put forth good effort (as supported by formal effort measures). (ref:he2) had good attention to tasks and persisted even on challenging items. For paper-and-pencil tests, (ref:he) used (ref:his) right hand with good pencil control. Test results are believed to be a valid reflection of (ref:his) functioning.
