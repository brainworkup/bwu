## Behavioral Observations

### Mental Status

(ref:first-name) was seen in-person at the USC Psychiatry and Behavioral Health
Services (PBHS) clinic on the University Park Campus. (ref:he-she-cap) attended the
appointments with (ref:his-her) parents. (ref:he-she-cap) was evaluated across
two 4-hour testing sessions scheduled a week apart in a physically-distanced
testing environment. A number of precautionary safety measures were employed
(e.g., masks, gloves, plexiglass dividers) while minimizing interference with
standardized testing procedures. 

(ref:first-name) arrived on time to the interview. (ref:he-she-cap) was alert, oriented to the situation, and appeared to understand the questions that were being asked of (ref:him-her). (ref:he-she-cap) was articulate, demonstrated a clear and logical thought process, and (ref:his-her) speech was normal in rate, pitch and prosody. (ref:his-her-cap) affect was normal in range and expression.

(ref:first-name) had taken (ref:his-her) prescribed medications the day of testing. (ref:he-she-cap) transitioned appropriately to begin testing. (ref:he-she-cap) was quiet and reserved but pleasant. (ref:he-she-cap) spoke little outside of responding to test items, but (ref:his-her) speech was typical for (ref:his-her) age. (ref:his2) language expression and comprehension were age-appropriate. (ref:first-name) was cooperative with testing and seemed motivated to do well. (ref:his2) affect was somewhat restricted in range and expression but positive, and (ref:he-she) showed a full range of emotions. Eye contact was good and appropriate to situation. (ref:he-she-cap) put forth good effort (as supported by formal effort measures). (ref:he-she-cap) had good attention to tasks and persisted even on challenging items. For paper-and-pencil tests, (ref:he-she) used (ref:his-her) right hand with good pencil control. Test results are believed to be a valid reflection of (ref:his-her) functioning.

### Patient Interview

(ref:first-name) described a great deal of forgetfulness. (ref:he-she-cap) said that (ref:he) forgets a lot of academic material, no matter how much (ref:he-she) studies. (ref:he-she-cap) also reported forgetting tasks (ref:he-she) needs to do, conversations, and recent events. (ref:he-she-cap) denied difficulties remembering past experiences (e.g. vacations), people's names, or faces. (ref:he-she-cap) noted that memory cues help sometimes. (ref:he-she-cap) reported not noticing much difference on medication but that (ref:he) does focus better. (ref:first-name) said (ref:he) is a little slow to process information. (ref:he-she-cap) described poor time management
skills. (ref:first-name) said that (ref:he-she) has to re-take several classes from last year because of missing all of 2nd quarter. (ref:he-she-cap) described English as (ref:his-her) weakest subject and math as (ref:his-her) strongest. (ref:he-she-cap) said that (ref:he-she) forgets what (ref:he-she) has read so (ref:he-she) struggles with reading comprehension. (ref:he-she-cap) expressed interest in design.
