Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was _Below Average_
overall.
Recall of the list after a long delay was _Exceptionally Low_ secondary to (ref:his-her) difficulties initially encoding the list of words.
Recall of more complex verbal information (short stories) was _Exceptionally Low_ for immediate free recall across measures.
Delayed recall of the stories was _Exceptionally Low_.
Learning and recognition of visual material (abstract shapes) was _Exceptionally Low_. Recognition of the shapes after a delay was _Below Average_, suggesting slightly improved memory consolidation over time.
Reconstructing a complex/abstract visual design from memory after a delay was _Exceptionally Low_.
