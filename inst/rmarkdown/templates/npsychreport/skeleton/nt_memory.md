Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was *Below average*
overall. Recall of the list after a long delay was *Exceptionally low* secondary to (ref:his-her) difficulties initially encoding the list of words. Recall of more complex verbal information (short stories) was *Exceptionally low* for immediate free recall across measures. Delayed recall of the stories was *Exceptionally low*. Learning and recognition of visual material (abstract shapes) was *Exceptionally low*. Recognition of the shapes after a delay was *Below average*, suggesting slightly improved memory consolidation over time. Reconstructing a complex/abstract visual design from memory after a delay was *Exceptionally low*.
