(ref:standard-score) Score = Standard score (M = 100, SD = 15)

(ref:scaled-score) Score = Scaled score (M = 10, SD = 3)

(ref:t-score) Score = *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10)

(ref:z-score) Score = *z*-score (M = 0, SD = 1)

(ref:zplot) *z* = -1 (16th percentile), *z* = 0 (50th percentile), and *z* = 1
(84th percentile)

(ref:pct) A percentile score shows `r params$fname`'s standing relative to
peers. For example, a percentile score of 75 means `r params$fname` performed as
well as or better than 75% of children the same age.

(ref:br) A base rate is the prevalence of score in the U.S. population. If a
score is rare, defined as a base rate of less than 10%, it is considered
clinically significant, and that area of functioning is probably causing
problems in the real world.

(ref:basc3-footnote) Score = *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10); *Note:* Adaptive
Skills *T* scores are reversed

(ref:basc3-fn-srp-adol) Score = *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10); *Note:* Personal
Adjustment *T* scores are reversed

(ref:g) *General intelligence* refers to an overall capacity to reason, to solve
problems, and to learn useful information.

(ref:gc) *Crystallized intelligence* refers to the ability to learn and use
language to reason and understand how the world works.

(ref:gf) *Fluid intelligence* refers to the ability to use logical reasoning to
figure things out without being told exactly how things work, analyze and solve
novel problems, identify patterns and relationships that underpin these
problems, and apply logic.

(ref:acad) *Reading ability* consists of three interrelated abilities: decoding,
comprehension, and fluency. *Writing ability* can be described in terms of
spelling, grammar, expression of ideas, and writing fluency. *Math ability* can
be described in terms of calculation skills, applied problem solving, and math
fluency.

(ref:read) *Reading ability* can be described as consisting of three
interrelated abilities: decoding (the ability to recognize and pronounce written
words presented without context), comprehension (the ability not only to
understand the facts presented in the text but also the ability to figure out
things in the text that are not directly stated), and fluency (the ability to
decode and understand simple written information in a rapid and fluent manner).

(ref:write) *Writing ability* can be described in terms of spelling, grammar,
expression of ideas, and writing fluency. Spelling ability and writing fluency
help one write quickly and with quality. If these lower-level skills don't flow
easily, they can take up attention and working memory space so that more
important skills such as making good choices about words and meaning (i.e.,
expression), and capitalizing on background grammar knowledge to construct good
pieces of writing cannot be used as easily.

(ref:math) *Math ability* can be described in terms of calculation skills,
applied problem solving (e.g., word problems), and math fluency.

(ref:vrb) *Verbal/language* refers to the ability to access and apply acquired
word knowledge, to verbalize meaningful concepts, to understand complex
multistep instructions, to think about verbal information, and to express
oneself using words.

(ref:spt) *Visuoperception, construction, and general visuospatial processing*
refer to abilities such as mentally visualizing how objects should look from
different angles, visualizing how to put objects together so that they fit
correctly, and being able to accurately and efficiently copy and/or reproduce
visual-spatial information onto paper.

(ref:att-exe) *Attentional and executive functions* underlie most, if not all,
domains of cognitive performance. These are behaviors and skills that allow
individuals to successfully carry-out instrumental and social activities,
academic work, engage with others effectively, problem solve, and successfully
interact with the environment to get needs met.

(ref:att) Attention is a basic function that underlies most, if not all, domains
of neurocognitive functioning. If an individual has limited attentional
capacity, an inability to sustain or divide attentional focus, or a reduced
ability to selectively attend to competing stimuli, then they would likely be
unable to interact with the environment to an adequate degree and, thus have
limited functioning in other, higher-order areas.

(ref:exe) Measures of executive functioning are used as proxies for behaviors
and skills that allow individuals to successfully carry-out instrumental and
social activities, such as planning, engaging with others effectively, problem
solving, and successfully interacting with the environment to get needs met.

(ref:wm) *Working memory* is the system responsible for the transient holding
and processing of information in conscious awareness just long enough to use it
for problem solving, and plays a critical role in reasoning, comprehension, and
learning.

(ref:ps) *Processing speed* refers to the rate at which the brain can
repetitively process familiar and unfamiliar information during relatively easy
tasks that almost everyone can do. Processing speed tests are good predictors of
performance on tasks that are so well learned that they are nearly automatic,
which can be critical to completing work efficiently.

(ref:mem) *Learning and memory* refer to the rate and ease with which new
information (e. g., facts, stories, lists, faces, names) can be encoded, stored,
and later recalled from long-term memory.

(ref:mtr) *Sensorimotor* tasks refer to the capacity to control hand movements
quickly, smoothly, and with adequate precision, which are required to engage in
activities such as writing and drawing.

(ref:soccog) *Social cognition* measures are used to gauge aspects of
social-emotional processing and social aptitude (sometimes referred to as
emotional intelligence), which are important facets of how individuals process
social information about other children, adults, groups, and social contexts.

(ref:cc) *Cognitive control* guides behavior by controlling what, when, and how
information is represented in the brain. Cognitive control is associated with a
wide range of processes and is not restricted to a particular cognitive domain.
Impairments in cognitive control functions are associated with specific deficits
in attention, memory, language comprehension and emotional processing.

(ref:adhd) *ADHD* is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of
inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that
is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the
moment without thought). Many ADHD symptoms, such as high activity levels,
difficulty remaining still for long periods of time and limited attention spans,
are common to children and adolescents in general, and even many adults. The
difference in individuals with ADHD is that their hyperactivity and inattention
are noticeably greater than expected for their age and cause distress and/or
problems functioning at home, at school, at work, or with friends.

(ref:dysgraphia) *Dysgraphia* is an impairment in writing, including problems
with letter formation/legibility, letter spacing, spelling, fine motor
coordination, rate of writing, grammar, and composition. DSM-5 categorizes
writing impairment as a "specific learning disability with impairment in written
expression" (spelling accuracy, grammar and punctuation accuracy, and clarity
and organization of written expression) [@chungDisorderWrittenExpression2020].

(ref:odd) *Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)* is a tendency to oppose and
defy. DSM-5 categorizes ODD under Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorder. It is described as a pattern of persistent anger, hostility, and
argumentative behavior that persists for more than six months.

(ref:dyslexia) Dyslexia means an individual has a neurobiologically based
cognitive processing problem that affects how easily and efficiently they can
learn to read. Approximately 24% of individuals diagnosed with dyslexia are able
to achieve reading skills commensurate with nondyslexic peers. A concept in the
research literature is one of "compensated dyslexia"
[@vanviersenHighReadingSkills2016], which is used to describe these individuals
because they use strengths in other areas to compensate for deficits in reading.
Dyslexia is underidentified in this population because the dyslexia can be
masked by strengths in vocabulary and intelligence, making it especially
difficult to identify in high-achieving individuals.

## Reason for Referral

`r params$fname` is a (ref:age)-year-old youngster who presents for neuropsychological
evaluation to determine `r params$his` cognitive, academic, and emotional
strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of the
evaluation is to provide diagnostic clarification and to strategize how to best
prepare `r params$fname` moving forward in middle school and high school. This
report is based on a review of available medical records and information
gathered across multiple days of evaluation. Results and recommendations were
discussed with `r params$fname`'s parents, Dad and Mom, `r params$lname`, on the last of these evaluation dates during interactive
feedback, and with `r params$fname` a week later.

## Background

## Relevant History

### Developmental/Medical

No birth complications. Normal developmental milestones.

### Family

`r params$fname` lives with `r params$his` parents Dad and Mom, and his
sister (age x) and brother (age x) in Los Angeles, CA. Dr. `r params$lname`
is a X and Mrs. `r params$lname` X. When asked about major changes in the family situation or family
stressors over the past year, `r params$fname`'s parents reported no major
stressors other than the pandemic. Unremarkable family medical history.

-   (ref:brown-efa-parent)

## Behavioral Observations

`r params$fname` was seen in-person at the USC Psychiatry and Behavioral Health
Services (PBHS) clinic on the University Park Campus. `r params$he` attended the
appointments with `r params$his` parents. `r params$he2` was evaluated across
two 4-hour testing sessions scheduled a week apart in a physically-distanced
testing environment. A number of precautionary safety measures were employed
(e.g., masks, gloves, plexiglass dividers) while minimizing interference with
standardized testing procedures.

It was a pleasure to work with `r params$fname` and easy to establish rapport.
`r params$his2` general level of expressivity was high and `r params$he` easily
initiated spontaneous conversation topics and maintained reciprocal
communication. `r params$he2` was pleasant and friendly with a good sense of
humor. `r params$his2` affect was full in range and expression, and
`r params$he` showed a full range of emotions. Eye contact was good and
appropriate to situation. No gross behavioral apathy or disinhibition.
`r params$fname` was cooperative and responded to questions in a polite and
forthright manner to the best of `r params$his` abilities. `r params$he2`
persisted on challenging items and put forth good effort (as supported by formal
effort tests). The evaluation in its entirety is an accurate representation of
`r params$his` functioning at this time, and the results presented herein are
considered valid for interpretation.

Finally, as detailed below, `r params$fname` evidenced marked test performance
anxiety that negatively impacted his performance in several areas and appears to
be a real world difficulty for him.

\newpage

## Test Results

\autoref{fig:gauss-plot-narrow} can be used as a guide to help interpret
individual test scores in terms of the degree of distance a score fell in
relation to normative and developmental expectations (i.e., the mean).
\autoref{fig:gauss-plot-broad} can be used to help interpret broad domains in
terms of the degree of clinical severity. Test scores are easiest to interpret
as percentiles[^3], which are provided in the tables below, and as *z*-scores (M
= 0, SD = 1)[^4], which are used to plot the various test and domain scores
below.

[^3]: (ref:pct)

(ref:gauss-plot-narrow) Statistical classification of neuropsychological test
scores in the general population [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020].

```{r gauss-plot-narrow, fig.cap='(ref:gauss-plot-narrow)', fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.pos = '!ht'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_narrow.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

(ref:gauss-plot-broad) General clinical interpretation of performance for
individual test scores and broader neuropsychological domains
[@schoenbergReportingStandardsNeuropsychological2017].

knitr::include_graphics("plot_broad.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


\newpage

### Verbal/Language

All scores in this area were *average* to *above average*. An exception was
`r params$his` phonemic word fluency score, which was *low-average* and a
relative weakness. Phonemic fluency is a component of broader phonological
awareness, which is a core building block to reading development in early
childhood. This is perhaps a residual weakness related to his early nonspecific
reading difficulties in kindergarten and current relative reading comprehension
difficulties.

(ref:fn-verbal) Score = Standard score (M = 100, SD = 15), *T* score (M = 50, SD
= 10), or Scaled score (M = 10, SD = 3)

\newpage

### Visual Perception/Construction

All scores in this area were *average* to *above average*. Notably, test scores
were a full standard deviation higher when measures of spatial construction and
simultaneous information processing/problem solving were secondarily rescored as
correct if `r params$fname` completed them correctly if given twice as much time
time (e.g., if an item had a 20" time limit and `r params$fname` got it correct
within 40").

(ref:fn-spatial) Score = Standard score (M = 100, SD = 15), *T* score (M = 50,
SD = 10), or Scaled score (M = 10, SD = 3)

\newpage

### Attention/Executive

Complex working memory and concept formation/inductive reasoning were areas of
notable strength for `r params$fname`. Cognitive control and planning/problem
solving were about average. Verbal and spatial processing speed were variable,
but in general processing speed was one of `r params$fname`'s weakest areas on
exam. Cognitive flexibility and rapid set-shifting were areas of relative
weakness as well. Scores on timed tests varied, but tended to be weaker than on
untimed tests.

Parent reports fell in the moderately elevated range on areas of behavioral
activation (organizing, prioritizing, and activating to work), focus (focusing,
sustaining, and shifting attention to tasks), emotion regulation (managing
frustration and modulating emotions), memory (utilizing working memory and
accessing information from long-term recall), and overall executive and
attentional functioning.



\newpage

### Memory

Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was *average*
overall, and `r params$fname` showed a variable learning curve[^7]. Recall of
the list after a brief delay was *average*. Recall after a longer delay was
*low-average* secondary to his variable learning curve resulting in disorganized
initial encoding of the words, which was his only memory score falling somewhat
below age-expectations. Recall of more complex verbal information (short story)
was *high-average* for immediate free recall. Recall of visual material
(abstract shapes) was *high-average*. Recall after a long delay was *above
average*. Reconstructing a complex/abstract visual design from memory after a
brief delay was intact.

[^7]: He had recalled as many as 14/15 words correctly during the learning
    trials, but then retrieved 9/15 on the later recall trials.


(ref:fn-memory) Score = *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10) or Scaled score (M = 10, SD
= 3)


\newpage

### Motor

All scores in this area were *average* to *exceptionally high*. Fine motor speed
and dexterity were intact bilaterally. No evidence of atypical lateralization of
fine or gross motor skills. No evidence of dyspraxia. Graphomotor speed and
accuracy (i.e., graphomotor control) was *exceptionally high*; `r params$fname`
completed the task with great precision and fluid pencil control. Gross motor
functioning including balance and gait appeared intact on observation.


(ref:fn-motor) Score = *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10) or Scaled score (M = 10, SD =
3)


\newpage

### Emotional/Behavioral/Adaptive

No clinical elevations were indicated on parent rating scales nor on
`r params$fname`'s self-report rating scales.

# SUMMARY/IMPRESSION

(ref:domain) *Key Findings:* Academic and intellectual skills are
`r params$fname`'s strengths. Processing speed and cognitive inflexibility are
areas of relative weakness. Notably, even `r params$fname`'s average scores
reflect performances that are below cognitive expectations for `r params$him`.
His ability to consistently demonstrate these skills is sometimes limited by
performance anxiety and overconcern with correctness, however. *Note:* *z* = 0

## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

`r params$fname` is a (ref:age)-year-old student who is currently in the
`r params$educ` at XX Elementary School. `r params$he2` was referred for testing
by his parents to assess `r params$his` current cognitive, academic, and
emotional functioning. Without question, `r params$fname` is an immensely
talented and endearing youngster who presents with a multitude of intellectual
and interpersonal strengths that will no doubt serve `r params$him` well in
future academic and social endeavors. `r params$his2` general intellectual
skills are in the high-average range for `r params$his` age, which means
`r params$he` will be able to keep up with or outpace `r params$his` peers on a
wide variety of cognitive and problem-solving tasks. Working memory is strong.
His academic skills are even stronger, with several test scores ranging 1-2
standard deviations above the norm for his age and grade level. His current
achievement scores are markedly higher than the scores he obtained when he
completed the middle school placement exams a few months ago. Verbal/language
processing and nonverbal reasoning/problem solving are average to above average;
relative weaknesses across tests from both domains are secondary to his
performance anxiety rather than actual cognitive difficulties. Memory and motor
functioning is intact.

# APPENDIX

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive
performance assessed during this neuropsychological evaluation is summarized
above. Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included. Cultural
considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and
making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Results from formal tests are
reported in comparison to other individuals the same age, sex, and educational
level as range of functioning (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions
of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted
within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and
necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a
normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or
treatment recommendations.
