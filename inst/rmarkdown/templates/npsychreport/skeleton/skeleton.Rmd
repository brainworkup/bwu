(ref:standard-score) Standard score (M = 100, SD = 15)

(ref:scaled-score) Scaled score (M = 10, SD = 3)

(ref:t-score) *T* score (M = 50, SD = 10)

(ref:z-score) *z*-score (M = 0, SD = 1)

(ref:zplot) *z* = -1 (16th percentile), *z* = 0 (50th percentile), and *z* = 1 (84th percentile)

(ref:pct) A *percentile* shows `r params$first_name`'s standing relative to peers. For example, a percentile score of 70 means `r params$first_name` performed as well as or better than 70% of individuals the same age.

(ref:br) A *base rate* is the prevalence of score in the general population. If a score is rare, defined as a base rate of less than 10%, it is considered *clinically significant*, and that area of functioning is probably causing problems in daily life.

(ref:basc3-footnote) Score = *T* (M = 50, SD = 10); *Note:* Adaptive Skills *T* scores are reversed

(ref:basc3-fn-srp-adol) Score = *T* (M = 50, SD = 10); *Note:* Personal Adjustment *T* scores are reversed

(ref:g) *General intelligence* refers to an overall capacity to reason, to solve problems, and to learn useful information.

(ref:gc) *Crystallized intelligence* refers to the ability to learn and use language to reason and understand how the world works.

(ref:gf) *Fluid intelligence* refers to the ability to use logical reasoning to figure things out without being told exactly how things work, analyze and solve novel problems, identify patterns and relationships that underpin these problems, and apply logic.

(ref:gcf) *General cognitive functioning* refers to an overall capacity to reason, to solve problems, and to learn useful information.

(ref:acad) *Reading ability* consists of three interrelated abilities: decoding, comprehension, and fluency. *Writing ability* can be described in terms of spelling, grammar, expression of ideas, and writing fluency. *Math ability* can be described in terms of calculation skills, applied problem solving, and math fluency.

(ref:read) *Reading ability* can be described as consisting of three interrelated abilities: decoding (the ability to recognize and pronounce written words presented without context), comprehension (the ability not only to understand the facts presented in the text but also the ability to figure out things in the text that are not directly stated), and fluency (the ability to decode and understand simple written information in a rapid and fluent manner).

(ref:write) *Writing ability* can be described in terms of spelling, grammar, expression of ideas, and writing fluency. Spelling ability and writing fluency help one write quickly and with quality. If these lower-level skills don't flow easily, they can take up attention and working memory space so that more important skills such as making good choices about words and meaning (i.e., expression), and capitalizing on background grammar knowledge to construct good pieces of writing cannot be used as easily.

(ref:math) *Math ability* can be described in terms of calculation skills, applied problem solving (e.g., word problems), and math fluency.

(ref:vrb) *Verbal/language* refers to the ability to access and apply acquired word knowledge, to verbalize meaningful concepts, to understand complex multistep instructions, to think about verbal information, and to express oneself using words.

(ref:spt) *Visuoperception, visuoconstruction, and visuospatial processing* refer to abilities such as mentally visualizing how objects should look from different angles, visualizing how to put objects together so that they fit correctly, and being able to accurately and efficiently copy and/or reproduce visual-spatial information onto paper.

(ref:att-exe) *Attentional* and *executive functions* underlie most, if not all, domains of cognitive performance. These are behaviors and skills that allow individuals to successfully carry-out instrumental and social activities, academic work, engage with others effectively, problem solve, and successfully interact with the environment to get needs met.

(ref:att) *Attention* is a basic function that underlies most, if not all, domains of neurocognitive functioning. If an individual has limited attentional capacity, an inability to sustain or divide attentional focus, or a reduced ability to selectively attend to competing stimuli, then they would likely be unable to interact with the environment to an adequate degree and, thus have limited functioning in other, higher-order areas.

(ref:exe) Measures of *executive functioning* are used as proxies for behaviors and skills that allow individuals to successfully carry-out instrumental and social activities, such as planning, engaging with others effectively, problem solving, and successfully interacting with the environment to get needs met.

(ref:wm) *Working memory* is the system responsible for the transient holding and processing of information in conscious awareness just long enough to use it for problem solving, and plays a critical role in reasoning, comprehension, and learning.

(ref:ps) *Processing speed* refers to the rate at which the brain can repetitively process familiar and unfamiliar information during relatively easy tasks that almost everyone can do. Processing speed tests are good predictors of performance on tasks that are so well learned that they are nearly automatic, which can be critical to completing work efficiently.

(ref:mem) *Learning and memory* refer to the rate and ease with which new information (e. g., facts, stories, lists, faces, names) can be encoded, stored, and later recalled from long-term memory.

(ref:mtr) *Sensorimotor* tasks refer to the capacity to control hand movements quickly, smoothly, and with adequate precision, which are required to engage in activities such as writing and drawing.

(ref:soc-cog) *Social cognition* measures are used to gauge aspects of social-emotional processing and social aptitude (sometimes referred to as emotional intelligence), which are important facets of how individuals process social information about other children, adults, groups, and social contexts.

(ref:cog-ctrl) *Cognitive control* guides behavior by controlling what, when, and how information is represented in the brain. Cognitive control is associated with a wide range of processes and is not restricted to a particular cognitive domain. Impairments in cognitive control functions are associated with specific deficits in attention, memory, language comprehension and emotional processing.

(ref:adhd) *ADHD* is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought). Many ADHD symptoms, such as high activity levels, difficulty remaining still for long periods of time and limited attention spans, are common to children and adolescents in general, and even many adults. The difference in individuals with ADHD is that their hyperactivity and inattention are noticeably greater than expected for their age and cause distress and/or problems functioning at home, at school, at work, or with friends.

(ref:dysgraphia) *Dysgraphia* is an impairment in writing, including problems with letter formation/legibility, letter spacing, spelling, fine motor coordination, rate of writing, grammar, and composition. DSM-5 categorizes writing impairment as a "specific learning disability with impairment in written expression" (spelling accuracy, grammar and punctuation accuracy, and clarity and organization of written expression) [@chungDisorderWrittenExpression2020].

(ref:odd) *Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)* is a tendency to oppose and defy. DSM-5 categorizes ODD under Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. It is described as a pattern of persistent anger, hostility, and argumentative behavior that persists for more than six months.

(ref:dyslexia) *Dyslexia* means an individual has a neurobiologically based cognitive processing problem that affects how easily and efficiently they can learn to read. Dyslexia is a common condition: some experts believe 5-10% of people have it; others say as many as 17% of people show signs of reading challenges. Dyslexia is formally classified as a specific learning disability in reading. People with dyslexia have trouble reading at a good pace and without mistakes. They may also have a hard time with reading comprehension, spelling, and writing. Importantly, these challenges are not a problem with intelligence.

(ref:comp-dyslexia) *Dyslexia* means an individual has a neurobiologically based cognitive processing problem that affects how easily and efficiently they can learn to read. Approximately 24% of individuals diagnosed with dyslexia are able to achieve reading skills commensurate with nondyslexic peers. A concept in the research literature is one of "compensated dyslexia"[@vanviersenHighReadingSkills2016], which is used to describe these individuals because they use strengths in other areas to compensate for deficits in reading. Dyslexia is underidentified in this population because the dyslexia can be masked by strengths in vocabulary and intelligence, making it especially difficult to identify in high-achieving individuals.

## Test Results

\autoref{fig:gauss-plot-narrow} can be used as a guide to help interpret individual test scores in terms of the degree of distance a score fell in relation to normative and developmental expectations (i.e., the mean).
\autoref{fig:gauss-plot-broad} can be used to help interpret broad domains in terms of the degree of clinical severity.
Test scores are easiest to interpret as percentiles[^1], which are provided in the tables below, and as *z*-scores (M = 0, SD = 1)[^2], which are used to plot the various test and domain scores below

# SUMMARY/IMPRESSION

(ref:domain) *Key Findings:* Verbal skills are significantly stronger than nonverbal/spatial processing skills. Attentional fluency (i.e., working memory and processing speed) and abstract reasoning are areas of weakness. Notably, even (ref:first-name)'s normatively average scores reflect performances that are well below cognitive expectations for (ref:him-her). *Note:* *z* = 0 (mean) ± 1 (sd)

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive performance assessed during this neuropsychological evaluation is summarized above.
Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included.
Cultural considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations.
Results from formal tests are reported in comparison to other individuals the same age, sex, and educational level as range of functioning (e.g., below average, average, above average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
