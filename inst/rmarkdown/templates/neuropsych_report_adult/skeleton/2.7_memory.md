### Memory

Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was Average overall.
Recall of the list after a short delay was Average. Recall of the list after a
long delay was Average, as (ref:he-she) was able to recall nearly all the
material (ref:he-she) had learned. Memory recall of more complex verbal information (short story) was Average for immediate free recall. Delayed recall
of the story details was preserved|diminished over time. Learning and
recognition of visual material (abstract shapes) was Average. Recognition of the
target visual material among non-target distractors after a delay period was
Average, suggesting stable memory consolidation over time. Finally, spontaneous,
long-term delayed recall (20-25 min) recall and reproduction of a complex
abstract figure fell within the Average range.
