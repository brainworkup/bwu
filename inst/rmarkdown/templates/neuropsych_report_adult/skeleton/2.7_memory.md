### Memory

Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was Average overall.
Recall of the list after a short delay was Average secondary to (ref:his-her)
difficulties encoding the information. Recall of the list after a long delay was
intact, as (ref:he-she) was able to recall nearly all the material (ref:he-she)
had learned. Memory recall of more complex verbal information (short story) was
Average for immediate free recall across multiple measures. Delayed recall of
the story details was preserved/diminshed over time. Learning and recognition of
visual material (abstract shapes) was Average. Recognition of the target visual
material among nontarget distractors after a delay period was Average,
suggesting slightly improved memory consolidation over time. Reconstructing a
complex/abstract visual design from memory after a delay was intact.
