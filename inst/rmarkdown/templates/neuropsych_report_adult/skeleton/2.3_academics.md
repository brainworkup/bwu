### Academic Skills

(ref:first-name)'s broad academic achievement and academic fluency skills fell
in the Average range for (ref:his-her) age and grade-level. Math fluency, math
calculation, and quantitative reasoning were Average to Exceptionally High.
(ref:he-she-cap) demonstrated Average written expression skills on measures of
word spelling and expository writing, and Average writing speed/fluency. By
contrast, there were statistically significant and clinically meaningful
differences between (ref:first-name)'s predicted scores (based on (ref:his-her)
cognitive ability) and the scores (ref:he-she) actually obtained on measures of
reading achievement. While reading comprehension stood out as a strength, there
were 21-25 point discrepancies between (ref:his-her) predicted and obtained
scores on the Word Reading subtest and the Reading composite. These differences
are significant and so large that they are not commonly found in the general
population (2%-5%), indicating a notable personal weakness in reading decoding.
A pattern of strengths and weakness (PSW) analysis indicated reduced working
memory capacity contributes to (ref:first-name)'s low reading scores and very
likely constrains learning.
