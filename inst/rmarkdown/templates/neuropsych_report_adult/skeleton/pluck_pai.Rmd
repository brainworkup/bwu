# PAI

## Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-11.jdk/Contents/Home")
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx16000m")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  root.dir = normalizePath("./"),
  echo = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  error = TRUE
)
library(bwu)
library(dplyr)
library(hablar)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(magrittr)
library(miniUI)
library(readr)
library(rJava)
library(rmarkdown)
library(shiny)
library(tabulizer)
library(tabulizerjars)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(vroom)
```

## Patient

```{r patient}
patient <- params$patient
```

## Export PAI CSV file from PARiConnect

Need to export csv file from PARiConnect before processing.
"Export Client Data" tab, then click "Univ of Southern Cali" then "PAI".
Specify date range to exclude entire database.

## Import PAI CSV file from PARiConnect

Copy over to pre_csv.

```{r pluck}
plucked_table <- vroom::vroom(here::here(patient, "pre_csv", "pariconnectexportPAI.csv"), delim = ",", col_name = TRUE)
```

## PAI Index and Subscale Scores

### Subset and rename columns

```{r subset}
table <- plucked_table %>%
  dplyr::select(SOM_T:AGG_P_T) %>%
  tidyr::gather() %>%
  dplyr::rename(scale = key, score = value)
```

### Convert T scores to z scores to percentiles

```{r t2z2p}
table <- table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(z = (score - 50) / 10) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(percentile = trunc(pnorm(z) * 100)) %>%
  dplyr::select(scale, score, percentile)
```

### Change scale names
