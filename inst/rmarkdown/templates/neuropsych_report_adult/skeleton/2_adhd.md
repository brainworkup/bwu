- Planning (e.g., developing and implementing strategies to accomplish tasks, including planning ahead and making good decisions)
- Self-Monitoring (e.g., evaluating one's own behavior in order to determine when a different approach is necessary, including noticing and fixing mistakes, knowing when help is required, and understanding when a task is completed)
- Working Memory (e.g., keeping information in mind that is important for knowing what to do and how to do it, including remembering important things, instructions, and steps)
