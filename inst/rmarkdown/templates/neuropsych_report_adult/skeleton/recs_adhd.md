## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- Treatment options for ADHD include a combination of behavioral techniques,
  consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the
  maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic
  condition.(ref:first-name) may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of
  her symptoms is indicated with (ref:ref-doc).

- Individual therapy to address features of anxiety and heightened stress, to
  ward off any emerging depression, and to instill adaptive coping skills.
  Mindfulness, distress tolerance skills, and cognitive-behavioral techniques
  should be woven into the therapeutic process. Moreover, in addition to having
  difficulty understanding purely visual information, people with nonverbal
  difficulties can sometimes be uncomfortable interacting socially because they
  may not understand others' subtle nonverbal cues. In such cases, it can be
  useful to prepare for novel and/or complex social situations (e.g., groups,
  large gatherings, giving public presentations). Efforts that improve social
  skills can attenuate the relationship between social difficulties and
  subsequent internalizing symptoms. Formally, social skills training is a
  cognitive-behavioral approach that involves teaching people the prosocial
  skills to facilitate successful functioning in their typical environments.

## Recommendations for School

- Accommodated Testing: Continue to provide testing services as currently
  approved by the USC Disabilities Services Program. Extended time
  accommodations in particular are apt to more readily enable (ref:first-name)
  to demonstrate her competencies in a more effective and consistent manner,
  given her weakness in processing speed. Further, additional test taking time
  will enable (ref:first-name) to identify and utilize organizational strategies
  and allay feelings of anxiety that accompany time-intensive tasks to channel
  her skills in the most effective manner.

- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/) writing app. Use Focus Mode when ADHD is comorbid
  with perfectionism. Focus Mode can be crucial in reducing the temptation to
  continuously re-read and tweak your text.

  - [After all, everyone is distracted once in a while](https://ia.net/topics/after-all-everyone-is-distracted-once-in-a-while)

- ADHD and Executive Functioning: A variety of techniques can be used to improve
  (ref:first-name)’s attentional difficulties in the classroom and home. For
  example, multimodal presentation of verbal information (written and read
  aloud) will help diminish the impact of periodic lapses in attention. She
  should be alerted when essential material or instructions are being presented
  in the classroom, and she may need additional time to rehearse the
  information. A digital planner, iPhone, or laptop computer can be a helpful
  tool for individuals with attentional difficulties. Written checklists of the
  steps required to complete a task should be provided. (ref:first-name) can
  benefit from learning compensatory skills to apply independently such as how
  to become a more active listener, asking for repetition of instructions, and
  memory strategies such as rehearsal.

## Recommendations for Home/Family

- In considering Carol's social environment with respect to perceived stressors
  and the availability of social supports with which to deal with these
  stressors, she reports having a level of stress comparable to that of normal
  adults, with the demands of the environment buffered by numerous individuals
  to whom she can turn for support when needed. The combination of a highly
  developed system of social supports with a reasonably low stress environment
  is a favorable prognostic sign for future adjustment.

- Because of (ref:his-her) inattention, (ref:first-name) will need to work hard
  at becoming a better "listener" given (ref:his-her) relative difficulty
  processing highly detailed verbal information (e.g., when engaging in a
  back-and-forth conversation with someone). A basic step (ref:he-she) can take
  toward more effective listening includes _listening actively_, for example,
  paraphrasing what someone has just said; clarifying meaning; asking more
  questions until (ref:he-she) gets more of the picture; and giving feedback.
  (ref:he-she-cap) should share (ref:his-her) reactions in a nonjudgmental way.

- Set reminders. Calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists can provide
  additional assistance in remembering tasks.

- _Mindfulness_ is a technique in which (ref:first-name) can learn to ignore
  distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand. People of all ages
  can benefit from mindfulness training, which can help them to develop
  cognitive control.

- High quality sleep, balanced nutrition, and frequent, vigorous exercise are
  critical to maximizing attention and focus as well.

- Cognitive Flexibility: (ref:first-name) acknowledges that she can be overly
  concrete and rigid when it comes to frustration tolerance and problem-solving
  due to inflexible patterns of thinking. Flexible thinking skills can be
  practiced at home to help her move away from overly rigid thinking patterns.
  When people develop flexible thinking skills, they are better able to solve
  problems, engage in positive peer interactions, and focus better in school or
  at work. When they learn to shift their thoughts in the face of new
  information, they can work through change and transitions. It takes time to
  develop this important skill set, but it is a critical skill to develop that
  has long-term, real world implications. Self-talk is an example of this.
  Self-talk is an effective way to work through a problem that does not have an
  immediately obvious solution. For example, when faced with a problem to solve,
  (ref:first-name) should take a few deep breaths, state the problem, consider
  at least three solutions and choose one. When individuals learn to talk their
  way through problems, they experience less frustration and are better able to
  cope with unexpected change.

## Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation

Follow-up assessment is not recommended at this time unless further concerns
arise that need to be addressed.

## Recommendations for Medical/Health Care:

1. Pharmacotherapy: Consider a trial of longer-acting stimulant medication for
   ADHD such as Vyvanse, which is both effective for improving symptoms of
   inattention and has a lower risk of misuse compared to shorter-acting
   stimulants.

1. Psychotherapy: Individual therapy to address features of anxiety, heightened
   stress, ward off any emerging depression, and to instill adaptive coping
   skills. Mindfulness, distress tolerance skills, and cognitive-behavioral
   techniques should be woven into the therapeutic process. Moreover, in
   addition to having difficulty understanding purely visual information, people
   with nonverbal difficulties can sometimes be uncomfortable interacting
   socially because they may not understand others' subtle nonverbal cues. In
   such cases, it can be useful to prepare for novel and/or complex social
   situations (e.g., groups, large gatherings, giving public presentations).
   Efforts that improve social skills can attenuate the relationship between
   social difficulties and subsequent internalizing symptoms. Formally, social
   skills training is a cognitive-behavioral approach that involves teaching
   people the prosocial skills to facilitate successful functioning in their
   typical environments. Finally, try to enhance (ref:first-name)’s
   problem-solving skill set. Problem-solving enables an individual to identify
   negative thinking that occurs in a specific situation, recognize how those
   thoughts can lead to depressed mood or poor social interaction, and replace
   those thoughts and subsequent feelings with healthier ones. The goal of
   problem-solving skills training is to help (ref:first-name) to view
   situational conflicts (caused by a lack of positive reinforcement) as a
   dilemma to be resolved rather than as a hopeless situation.

1. ADHD and Executive Functioning: A variety of techniques can be used to
   improve (ref:first-name)’s attentional difficulties in the classroom and
   home. For example, multimodal presentation of verbal information (written and
   read aloud) will help diminish the impact of periodic lapses in attention.
   She should be alerted when essential material or instructions are being
   presented in the classroom, and she may need additional time to rehearse the
   information. A digital planner, PDA, or laptop computer can be a helpful tool
   for individuals with attentional difficulties. Written checklists of the
   steps required to complete a task should be provided. (ref:first-name) can
   benefit from learning compensatory skills to apply independently such as how
   to become a more active listener, asking for repetition of instructions, and
   memory strategies such as rehearsal.

## Recommendations for School:

1. Accommodated Testing: Continue to provide as currently approved by the USC
   Disabilities Services Program. Extended time accommodations in particular are
   apt to more readily enable (ref:first-name) to demonstrate her competencies
   in a more effective and consistent manner. Further, additional test taking
   time will enable (ref:first-name) to identify and utilize organizational
   strategies and allay feelings of anxiety that accompany time-intensive tasks
   to channel her skills in the most effective manner.

1. Classroom Recordings: (ref:first-name) should be provided with lecture
   notes/slides prior to class for advanced preparation and review and be
   allowed to audio or video record the lecture for later review.

1. Classroom Seating: (ref:first-name) should receive preferential seating in
   the classroom in order to minimize potential environmental distractions.

1. Academic Advisement: (ref:first-name) is likely to benefit from regular
   meetings with an academic advisor to review her academic progress and to
   acquire strategies to better organize academic materials and prepare for
   academic deadlines. Over time, efforts should be made to foster increased
   autonomy in this regard.

## Recommendations for Family/Home:

1. Fluid Reasoning: (ref:first-name) will benefit from structure and practice
   when approaching assignments and tasks that are challenging to her. With
   regard to specific fluid reasoning interventions, on her own, she can
   practice identifying patterns or look at a series and identify what comes
   next. She is encouraged to think of multiple ways to group objects and then
   explain her rationale. Asking questions about stories can further build fluid
   reasoning skills. For example, when reading a book or watching a film,
   (ref:first-name) should try to identify the main idea of the story. There is
   some preliminary research evidence that video gaming might improve scores on
   fluid reasoning measures as well. Since (ref:first-name) enjoys gaming, she
   is encouraged to keep playing during her downtime, or as a reward for having
   studied. She must be cautious not to overindulge in gaming, however.

1. Cognitive Flexibility: (ref:first-name) acknowledges that she can be overly
   concrete and rigid when it comes to frustration tolerance and problem solving
   due to inflexible patterns of thinking. Flexible thinking skills can be
   practiced at home to help her move away from overly rigid thinking patterns.
   When people develop flexible thinking skills, they are better able to solve
   problems, engage in positive peer interactions, and focus better in school or
   at work. When they learn to shift their thoughts in the face of new
   information, they can work through change and transitions. It takes time to
   develop this important skill set, but it is a critical skill to develop that
   has long-term, real world implications. Self-talk is an example of this.
   Self-talk is an effective way to work through a problem that does not have an
   immediately obvious solution. For example, when faced with a problem to
   solve, (ref:first-name) should take a few deep breaths, state the problem,
   consider at least three solutions and choose one. When individuals learn to
   talk their way through problems, they experience less frustration and are
   better able to cope with unexpected change.

1. Preparing and Studying for Exams: It will be extremely helpful to structure
   (ref:first-name)’s participation in the learning environment at home in order
   to maximize her attention and focus. Test preparation should begin far in
   advance to permit repeated exposure to the necessary information. In
   preparing for tests, brief, spaced, and repeated exposure will likely prove
   more effective than massed cramming sessions conducted immediately prior to
   examinations. Learning how to work in shorter intervals (with reinforcement
   following completion of individual task segments) will assist her in
   effectively directing her attention to the information being presented or
   learned. The environment should be free of clutter and visual and auditory
   distractions kept to a minimum.

1. Processing Speed and Repetition: Repetition is an important factor in
   building speed. Repeated and extensive practice will enable (ref:first-name)
   to perform some tasks in a more automatic fashion to increase performance
   speed. For example, in attempting to remember factual details
   (ref:first-name) should use flash cards or index cards, with a unique color
   allocated to each academic subject (or theme within a given subject). Facts
   should be introduced in a graduated manner (e.g., two or three at a time),
   and in turn, drilled to mastery. Once the newly introduced facts are mastered
   and recalled over several consecutive days, several subsequent facts should
   be introduced and drilled into mastery. As the process unfolds, the final
   portion of each review session should be devoted to reviewing the expanding
   pile of facts already mastered.

## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- Treatment options for ADHD include a combination of behavioral techniques,
  consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the
  maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic condition.
  (ref:first-name) may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of her symptoms
  is indicated with Dr. Augius.

- Continue with individual therapy to address features of anxiety and heightened
  stress, to ward off any emerging depression, and to instill adaptive coping
  skills. Mindfulness, distress tolerance skills, and cognitive-behavioral
  techniques should be woven into the therapeutic process. Moreover, in addition
  to having difficulty understanding purely visual information, people with
  nonverbal difficulties can sometimes be uncomfortable interacting socially
  because they may not understand others' subtle nonverbal cues. In such cases,
  it can be useful to prepare for novel and/or complex social situations (e.g.,
  groups, large gatherings, giving public presentations). Efforts that improve
  social skills can attenuate the relationship between social difficulties and
  subsequent internalizing symptoms. Formally, social skills training is a
  cognitive-behavioral approach that involves teaching people the prosocial
  skills to facilitate successful functioning in their typical environments.

## Recommendations for Work/School

- _Flexible work schedule_ Carol would benefit from a flexible schedule in order
  to work optimally during hours of increased attentiveness. A flexible schedule
  will also allow her to have a period of mental rest in order to refocus and
  reorient into her work. Three specific adjustments to her work schedule are
  suggested:
  1. Adjusting starting and ending times of her workday;
  1. Allowing for short breaks as needed;
  1. Allowing work to be completed during hours when Carol is most mentally
     alert.

- _Protected time for note completion_ Carol would benefit from uninterrupted
  time that is reserved to work on job tasks such as writing clinical notes so
  that she is better able to focus and avoid distraction.

- _Speech-to-text software_ Provide and allow Carol to use software that
  transcribes speech to text to enhance productivity for note writing tasks.
  [Suggested software/apps:](https://zapier.com/blog/best-text-dictation-software/)
  - Apple Dictation for a free app for Apple devices
  - Windows 10 Speech Recognition for a free app for Windows users
  - Dragon by Nuance for a customizable dictation app
  - Google Docs voice typing for dictating in Google Docs
  - Gboard for a free mobile dictation app
  - SpeechTexter for occasional use

- _Accommodated testing_ Extended time accommodations for high-stakes exams
  (e.g., licensure) in particular are apt to more readily enable
  (ref:first-name) to demonstrate her competencies in a more effective and
  consistent manner, given her weakness in processing speed. Further, additional
  test taking time will enable (ref:first-name) to identify and utilize
  organizational strategies and allay feelings of anxiety that accompany
  time-intensive tasks to channel her skills in the most effective manner.

- _Attention/executive functioning_ A variety of techniques can be used to
  improve (ref:first-name)’s attentional difficulties at school, home, or work.
  For example, multimodal presentation of verbal information (written and read
  aloud) will help diminish the impact of periodic lapses in attention. She
  should be alerted when essential material or instruction is being presented,
  and she may need additional time to rehearse the information. A digital
