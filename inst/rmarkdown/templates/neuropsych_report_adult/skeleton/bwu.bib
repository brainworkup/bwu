  abstract     = {Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) identifies emotion dysregulation as central to the dangerous impulsivity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) including substance use disorders, and DBT targets improved emotion regulation as a primary mechanism of change. However, improved emotion regulation with DBT and associations between such improvement and behavioral outcomes such as substance use has not been previously reported. Objective: Thus, the goal of this study was to assess for improvement in emotion regulation and to examine the relationship between improvements in the emotion regulation and substance use problems following DBT treatment. Method: Emotion regulation as assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, depressed mood as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, and their associations with substance use frequency were investigated in 27 women with substance dependence and BPD receiving 20 weeks of DBT in an academic community outpatient substance abuse treatment program. Results: Results indicated improved emotion regulation, improved mood, and decreased substance use frequency. Further, emotion regulation improvement, but not improved mood, explained the variance of decreased substance use frequency. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: This is the first study to demonstrate improved emotion regulation in BPD patients treated with DBT and to show that improved emotion regulation can account for increased behavioral control in BPD patients. Significance and future research: Emotion regulation assessment is recommended for future studies to further clarify the etiology and maintenance of disorders associated with emotional dysregulation such as BPD and substance dependence and to further explore emotion regulation as a potential mechanism of change for clinical interventions.},

  abstract     = {Background Late-preterm (LPT) birth accounts for a majority of preterm deliveries and until recently was considered low risk for poor cognitive outcome. Previously, we reported deficits in complicated LPT (cLPT) preschoolers (neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]-admitted). Aim To extend our prior study by comparing cognitive outcome in cLPT and uncomplicated LPT (uLPT; NICU non-admitted) preschoolers. Study design Single center retrospective cohort study of 118 LPT children born in 2004\textendash 2006 at 35\textendash 36weeks of gestation; 90 cLPT and 28 uLPT, compared with 100 term-born ({$\geq$}37weeks of gestation and {$\geq$}2500g) participants. Outcome measure A well-standardized measure of general conceptual ability (GCA), the Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition. Results cLPT participants had average mean performances but significantly poorer GCA, Nonverbal Reasoning, and Spatial scores than term-born children, and higher rates of Nonverbal Reasoning and Spatial impairment; uLPT did not differ from TERM. Combined LPT males were at eightfold greater risk than term-born males for nonverbal deficit, and at sevenfold greater risk for GCA impairment than LPT females. Conclusions Finding greater risk of cognitive deficit in those NICU-admitted due to clinical instability or birth weight {$<$}2kg compared with non-admitted preschoolers indicates that neonatal morbidities contribute to subtle cognitive deficits detectable at young age, with male gender an additive risk factor. LPT gestational age alone is an insufficient predictor of long-term neurocognitive outcome. Further study should elucidate salient etiologies for early emerging cognitive weaknesses and suggest appropriate interventions to prepare at-risk LPT preschoolers for elementary school entry.},

@article{baumCommunicationKeyUtility2018,
  abstract   = {Objective: The neuropsychological report is a critical tool for
                communicating evaluation results to multiple audiences who have
                varying knowledge about neuropsychology and often have limited
                ability to review long, complex reports. Considerable time is spent
                writing these reports and challenges persist related to readability
                , length/complexity, and billable clinical time (which may be
                capped by third-party payors or families' ability to pay). Methods:
                This quality improvement effort systematically evaluated the
                redesign of pediatric neuropsychological reports in an outpatient
                clinic serving primarily medical populations. Results: Revised
                reports were shorter, with improved readability, structure, and
                effectiveness in communicating results and recommendations.
                Improved clinical efficiency was also observed. Conclusions: We
                suggest that adaptation to efficient, readable, and effective
                reports is possible within the practice of neuropsychology.
                Findings encourage replication in other settings. Through
                collaboration with key stakeholders, providers can identify their
                populations' and audience's unique needs and set report targets
                accordingly. To encourage that practice, we summarize our general
                process, provide a set of guidelines that can be adapted across
                multiple settings, and include an appended sample report. },

  abstract     = {Writing is a complex task that is vital to learning and is usually
                  acquired in the early years of life. ‘Dysgraphia’ and ‘specific
                  learning disorder in written expression’ are terms used to describe
                  those individuals who, despite exposure to adequate instruction,
                  demonstrate writing ability discordant with their cognitive level
                  and age. Dysgraphia can present with different symptoms at
                  different ages. Different theories have been proposed regarding the
                  mechanisms of dysgraphia. Dysgraphia is poorly understood and is
                  often undiagnosed. It has a high rate of co-morbidity with other
                  learning and psychiatric disorders. The diagnosis and treatment of
                  dysgraphia and specific learning disorders typically centers around
                  the educational system; however, the pediatrician can play an
                  important role in surveillance and evaluation of co-morbidity as
                  well as provision of guidance and support.},

  abstract     = {Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a well-established treatment for individuals with multiple and severe psychosocial disorders, including those who  are chronically suicidal. Because many such patients have substance use disorders (SUDs), the authors developed DBT for Substance Abusers, which incorporates concepts and modalities designed to promote abstinence and to reduce the length  and adverse impact of relapses. Among these are dialectical abstinence, "clear  mind," and attachment strategies that include off-site counseling as well as  active attempts to find patients who miss sessions. Several randomized clinical trials have found that DBT for Substance Abusers decreased substance abuse in  patients with borderline personality disorder. The treatment also may be helpful  for patients who have other severe disorders co-occurring with SUDs or who have  not responded to other evidence-based SUD therapies.},

  abstract     = {Objectives: Descriptive labels of performance test scores are a
                  critical component of communicating outcomes of neuropsychological
                  and psychological evaluations. Yet, no universally accepted system
                  exists for assigning qualitative descriptors to scores in specific
                  ranges. In addition, the definition and use of the term
                  ``impairment'' lacks specificity and consensus. Consequently, test
                  score labels and the denotation of impairment are inconsistently
                  applied by clinicians, creating confusion among consumers of
                  neuropsychological services, including referral sources, trainees,
                  colleagues, and the judicial system. To reduce this confusion,
                  experts in clinical and forensic neuropsychological and
                  psychological assessment convened in a consensus conference at the
                  2018 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Clinical
                  Neuropsychology (AACN). The goals of the consensus conference were
                  to recommend (1) a system of qualitative labels to describe results
                  from performance-based tests with normal and non-normal
                  distributions and (2) a definition of impairment and its

  abstract     = {Background: This study examined neuropsychological functioning in a longitudinal sample of adolescents/young adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls as a function of the persistence of ADHD. We hypothesized that measures of executive processes would parallel adolescent clinical status, with ADHD-persisters, but not remitters, differing significantly from controls. In contrast, persisters and remitters were hypothesized to perform similarly, and different from controls, on tasks requiring less effortful processing. Methods: Ninety-eight participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated approximately 10 years later. Eighty-five never-ADHD controls similar in age, IQ, and sex distribution served as a comparison group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and neuropsychological test battery. Results: Those with childhood ADHD demonstrated broad neuropsychological deficits relative to controls. When the group with childhood ADHD was subdivided based on adolescent ADHD status, compared to controls, both persisters and remitters showed deficient perceptual sensitivity and response variability, and increased ankle movements recorded by a solid-state actigraph. Only persisters differed from controls on several measures of more effortful executive processes. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that ADHD is associated with early-appearing and enduring subcortical dysfunction, while recovery over the course of development is associated with improvements in executive control functions.},

                  can be found in nearly 20\% of school children. It is characterized
                  by evidences of immaturity involving control of activity, emotions,

                  between evaluated potential and actual classroom achievement.
                  Remedial efforts directed at early detection, relief from pressure
                  and unjust punishment or ridicule from parents and teachers, and
                  adjustment of the educational environment with consideration of the
                  child's individual talents, combined with the judicious use of
                  medications to prolong attention span and improve
                  neurodevelopmental maturity, hold promise of improving the lot of
                  most involved children. There are valid indications that expansion
                  of such programs can do much to prevent these youngsters from
                  developing severe personality maladjustment and delinquent behavior
                  , as well as emotional illness in later life.},

  abstract  = {The first volume to provide strategies proven effective in controlled clinical trials, this book is a comprehensive, integrated approach to therapy with [individuals with borderline personality disorder]. Marsha Linehan presents specific guidelines that creatively combine the best elements of behavioral, psychoanalytic, strategic, and other commonly employed modalities.  The first section of the book presents an overview of the disorder and lays out a theoretical framework to guide the therapy. The second describes in detail how to assess borderline patients and how to organize and prioritize treatment goals and behavioral targets. . . . For problem solving with borderline personality disorder, the book provides specific strategies for contingency management, exposure, cognitive modification, and skills training. The last component is further elucidated in the companion "Skills Training Manual."  Addressing the most stressful patient behaviors that clinicians encounter, the book includes a step-by-step outline for assessing suicide risk, managing suicide threats, and working with chronic suicidal behavior. Integrative approaches for such specific problems as crises, noncompliance, and breakdowns in the therapeutic relationship are also discussed.

However, most previous studies use cross-sectional designs, low-risk samples, and limited assessments of self-control. This study of 553 jail inmates examined the relationship of a valid measure of self-control (Brief Self-Control Scale) completed on incarceration with behavior before, during, and 1 year after incarceration. After controlling for positive impression management (PIM), self-control was negatively related to substance misuse, suicidality, risky sex, and criminal history prior to incarceration and post-release illegal substance misuse, recidivism, and positive adjustment. Lower self-control predicted increases in substance dependence at post-release compared with pre-incarceration. Self-control was not related to misbehavior during incarceration, nor alcohol use or HIV-risk behavior 1 year post-release. Results were consistent as a function of age, race, and gender. This study supports self-control as an important risk and protective factor in a sample of criminal offenders.},

Research has yet to identify which types of offenders  are at risk for, or in contrast, protected from, experiencing self-stigma.

Results showed that mental health symptoms were a consistent  risk factor across three of four self-stigma components, whereas antisocial  characteristics were a risk factor for stereotype agreement and internalized  stigma. Self-esteem was a protective factor for internalized and anticipated  stigma. Implications for preventing self-stigma among offenders are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Objective: The influence of anger experience, expression, and control on aggressive behavior has been the focus of much theoretical and empirical attention. The influence of other emotions and emotional processing facets on aggression has received less consideration. This study sought to determine whether failing to attend to upsetting emotions, including anger, is associated with aggression, beyond the effects of poor anger control. Method: Participants (n = 64) were criminal offenders who were mandated to attend Community Corrections Offices across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed measures of anger experience, expression and control, attention to emotions, past aggression, and verbal intelligence. Results: Results indicate that participants reporting difficulty attending to their emotions had more extensive histories of aggression than those who did not report such difficulties. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for trait anger and the ability to control the outward expression of anger. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of current approaches to violent offender treatment. In particular, it is recommended that intervention programs should seek to emphasize the importance of controlling aggressive behavior in the face of anger, while attending to (rather than avoiding or suppressing) the anger experience itself.

  abstract = {Objective Rapid, clear and efficient communication of
              neuropsychological results is essential to benefit patient care.
              Errors in communication are a lead cause of medical errors;
              nevertheless, there remains a lack of consistency in how
              neuropsychological scores are communicated. A major limitation in
              the communication of neuropsychological results is the inconsistent
              use of qualitative descriptors for standardized test scores and the
              use of vague terminology. Patients and methods PubMed search from 1
              Jan 2007 to 1 Aug 2016 to identify guidelines or consensus
              statements for the description and reporting of qualitative terms
              to communicate neuropsychological test scores was conducted. The
              review found the use of confusing and overlapping terms to describe
              various ranges of percentile standardized test scores. Results In
              response, we propose a simplified set of qualitative descriptors
              for normalized test scores (Q-Simple) as a means to reduce errors
              in communicating test results. The Q-Simple qualitative terms are:
              ‘very superior’, ‘superior’, ‘high average’, ‘average’, ‘low
              average’, ‘borderline’ and ‘abnormal/impaired’. A case example
              illustrates the proposed Q-Simple qualitative classification system
              to communicate neuropsychological results for neurosurgical
              planning. Conclusions The Q-Simple qualitative descriptor system is
              aimed as a means to improve and standardize communication of
              standardized neuropsychological test scores. Research are needed to
              further evaluate neuropsychological communication errors. Conveying

  abstract     = {First-episode schizophrenia (FES) spectrum disorders are associated with pronounced cognitive dysfunction across all domains. However, less is known about the course of cognitive functioning, following the first presentation of psychosis, and the relationship of cognition to clinical course during initial treatment. The present longitudinal study examined the magnitude of neurocognitive impairment, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis at baseline and after 12 weeks of randomized antipsychotic treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone. At baseline, FES patients evidenced marked impairments in cognitive functioning. Notably, performance on the mazes task of planning and reasoning significantly predicted the likelihood of meeting stringent criteria for positive symptom remission during the first 12 weeks of the trial. Performance on indices of general cognitive function, working memory, and verbal learning improved over time, but these improvements were mediated by improvements in both positive and negative symptoms. We did not detect any differential effects of antipsychotic medication assignment (aripiprazole vs risperidone) on cognitive functioning. Our results suggest that a brief paper-and-pencil measure reflecting planning/reasoning abilities may index responsivity to antipsychotic medication. However, improvements in cognitive functioning over time were related to clinical symptom improvement, reflecting "pseudospecificity."},

  abstract     = {This study investigated how gifted children with dyslexia might be
                  able to mask literacy problems and the role of possible
                  compensatory mechanisms. The sample consisted of 121 Dutch primary
                  school children that were divided over four groups (typically
                  developing [{TD}] children, children with dyslexia, gifted children
                  , gifted children with dyslexia). The test battery included
                  measures of literacy (reading/spelling) and cognitive abilities
                  related to literacy and language (phonological awareness [{PA}],
                  rapid automatized naming [{RAN}], verbal short-term memory [{VSTM}]
                  , working memory [{WM}], grammar, and vocabulary). It was
                  hypothesized that gifted children with dyslexia would outperform
                  children with dyslexia on literacy tests. In addition, a
                  core-deficit model including dyslexia-related weaknesses and a
                  compensational model involving giftedness-related strengths were
                  tested using Bayesian statistics to explain their reading/spelling
                  performance. Gifted children with dyslexia performed on all
                  literacy tests in between children with dyslexia and {TD} children.
                  Their cognitive profile showed signs of weaknesses in {PA} and {RAN
                  } and strengths in {VSTM}, {WM}, and language skills. Findings
                  indicate that phonology is a risk factor for gifted children with
                  dyslexia, but this is moderated by other skills such as {WM},
                  grammar, and vocabulary, providing opportunities for compensation
                  of a cognitive deficit and masking of literacy difficulties.},
