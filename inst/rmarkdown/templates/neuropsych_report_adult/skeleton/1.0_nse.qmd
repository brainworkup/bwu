### Telemedicine Statement

_I connected with the Patient by a video enabled telemedicine application and
verified that I am speaking with the correct person using two identifiers. I
discussed the limitations of evaluation and management by telemedicine and the
availability of in-person appointments. The patient expressed understanding and
agreed to proceed. I have verified this to be the correct patient and obtained
verbal consent from the patient to perform this voluntary telemedicine visit and
evaluation (including obtaining history from the patient). The patient has the
right to refuse this evaluation. I have explained risks (including potential
loss of confidentiality), benefits, alternatives, and the potential need for
subsequent face-to-face care. The patient understands that there is a risk of
medical inaccuracies given that our recommendations will be made based on
reported data (and we must therefore assume this information is accurate).
Knowing that there is a risk that this information is not reported accurately,
and that the telemedicine video, audio, or data feed may be incomplete, the
patient agrees to proceed with evaluation and holds Keck Medicine of USC
harmless knowing these risks. I have notified the patient that other healthcare
