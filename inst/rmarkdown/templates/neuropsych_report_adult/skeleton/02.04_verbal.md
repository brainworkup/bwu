(ref:first-name)'s language comprehension and expression skills were intact for
(ref:his-her) age, demographic background, and educational history, without a
clear pattern of strengths or weaknesses. Speech output and fluency were in the
Average range and above those of approximately 50% of (ref:his-her) peers.
Auditory comprehension (i.e., the ability to receive, process, and execute oral
instructions of increasing syntactic complexity) was Average. Visual
confrontation naming/word-finding was Average, with no obvious dysfluency in
conversational/informal expression. Reading comprehension and semantic
processing of both single words and sentences were at the expected level.
Narrative writing, verbal fluency, and spelling were collectively in the Average
range of functioning; a qualitative evaluation of (ref:first-name)â€™s handwriting
revealed adequate legibility, planning, and organization. Auditory language
comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, simple calculations, and speech
output were collectively Average on a bill payment task, indicating mildly
reduced processing information when pairing verbal and visual instructions.
