# Finalize and save

## Relocate variables

```{r relocate}
table <- table |> dplyr::relocate(c(raw_score, score, percentile, range, ci_95), .before = test)
```

## Write csv

```{r write}
readr::write_csv(table, here::here(patient, "csv", paste0(test, ".csv")), col_names = TRUE, na = "")
```

### Cleanup
