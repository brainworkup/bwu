## Behavioral Observations

(ref:he-she-cap) was evaluated during a 4-hour testing session in a physically-distanced testing environment.
(ref:he-she-cap) was seen in-person at our clinic on the USC campus.
Precautionary health safety measures were employed (e.g., masks, plexiglass dividers) during the evaluation, while minimizing interference with standardized testing procedures.
(ref:first-name) arrived on time to the test session.
(ref:he-she-cap) was alert, oriented to the situation, and appeared to understand the questions that were being asked of (ref:him-her).
(ref:he-she-cap) was articulate, demonstrated a clear and logical thought process, and (ref:his-her) speech was normal in rate, pitch, and prosody.
(ref:his-her-cap) language expression and comprehension were age-appropriate.
(ref:first-name) was cooperative with testing and seemed motivated to do well.
(ref:his-her-cap) affect was full in range and expression, and (ref:he-she) showed a full range of emotions.
Eye contact was good and appropriate to situation.
(ref:he-she-cap) had good attention to tasks and persisted even on challenging items.
For paper-and-pencil tests, (ref:he-she) used (ref:his-her) (ref:hand)-hand with good pencil control.
(ref:first-name) put forth good effort (as supported by formal effort measures: Word Choice, TOMM, RDS, CVLT-3 Forced-Choice Recognition).
Test results are believed to be a valid reflection of (ref:his-her) functioning at this time.
