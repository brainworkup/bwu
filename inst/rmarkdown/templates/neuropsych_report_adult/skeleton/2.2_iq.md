Reasoning (Gf) was Average. Processing Speed (Gs) performance (i.e., the
efficiency of cognitive processing or speed of mental activity, especially when
under pressure to maintain attention and concentration), was Average. An

information in immediate awareness and then manipulate or transform it in some
