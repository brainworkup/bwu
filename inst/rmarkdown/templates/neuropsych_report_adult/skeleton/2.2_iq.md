### Intelligence/General Ability

(ref:premorbid) _Premorbid Ability_ is an estimate of a personâ€™s intellectual
functioning prior to known or suspected onset of brain disease or dysfunction.

(ref:working-memory) _Working Memory_ refers to the ability to hold information
in immediate awareness and then manipulate or transform it in some way within a
few seconds.

(ref:processing-speed) _Processing Speed_ refers to the efficiency of cognitive
processing or speed of mental activity, especially when under pressure to
maintain attention and concentration.

An estimate of premorbid verbal ability level fell within the Exceptionally High
range.^[(ref:premorbid)] General Intelligence (G) was Average and ranked at the
50th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 50% of
same-aged peers from the general population. An estimate of Crystallized
Intelligence (Gc) was classified as Average and ranked at the 50th percentile.
Fluid Reasoning (Gf) was classified as Average. Working Memory (Gwm) was a
relative strength|weakness, falling in the Average range.^[(ref:working-memory)]
Processing Speed (Gs) performance was Average and a relative
strength|weakness.^[(ref:processing-speed)] Finally, broad neurocognitive
functioning (independent of general intelligence) across domains of attentional
and executive functioning, language and spatial processing, and learning and
memory was Average.
