# RECOMMENDATIONS {#sec-recs}

## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- Treatment options for ADHD include a combination of behavioral techniques,
  consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the
  maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic condition.
  `r params$first_name` may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of
  `r params$his_her` symptoms is indicated with one of our psychiatrists.

- _Psychotherapy_ Individual therapy to address features of anxiety, heightened
  stress, ward off any emerging depression, and to instill adaptive coping
  skills. Mindfulness, distress tolerance skills, and cognitive-behavioral
  techniques should be woven into the therapeutic process.

## Recommendations for School/High Stakes Exams

- _Accommodated testing_ Given her weakness in processing speed, extended time accommodations for high-stakes exams (e.g., BAR EXAM) in particular are apt to more readily enable `r params$first_name` to demonstrate `r params$his_her` competencies in a more effective and consistent manner, given `r params$his_her` weakness in processing speed. Further, additional test taking time will enable `r params$first_name` to identify and utilize organizational strategies and allay feelings of anxiety that accompany time-intensive tasks to channel `r params$his_her` skills in the most effective manner.

- _Classroom recordings_ `r params$first_name` should be provided with lecture
  notes/slides prior to class for advanced preparation and review and be allowed
  to audio or video record the lecture for later review.

- Set reminders. Calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists can provide
  additional assistance in remembering tasks.

- _Mindfulness_ is a technique in which `r params$first_name` can learn to ignore
  distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand. People of all ages
  can benefit from mindfulness training, which can help them to develop
  cognitive control.

- High quality sleep, balanced nutrition, and frequent, vigorous exercise are
  critical to maximizing attention and focus.

- _Processing speed and repetition_ Repetition is an important factor in
  building speed. Repeated and extensive practice will enable `r params$first_name`
  to perform some tasks in a more automatic fashion to increase performance
  speed. For example, in attempting to remember factual details `r params$first_name`
  should use flash cards or index cards, with a unique color allocated to each
  academic subject (or theme within a given subject). Facts should be introduced
  in a graduated manner (e.g., two or three at a time), and in turn, drilled to
  mastery. Once the newly introduced facts are mastered and recalled over
  several consecutive days, several subsequent facts should be introduced and
  drilled into mastery. As the process unfolds, the final portion of each review
  session should be devoted to reviewing the expanding pile of facts already
  mastered.

## Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation

- Follow-up assessment is not recommended at this time unless further concerns
  arise that need to be addressed.

- Follow-up assessment in 12-18 months is recommended to gauge
  `r params$first_name`'s progress and to assess the impact of the above
  interventions, unless further concerns arise that need to be addressed sooner.
