### Attention and Processing Speed 

No deficits identified.
- Auditory Attention Span: 6 forward, wnl.
- Verbal Working Memory: 5 digits reversed and 6 digits sequenced,wnl.
- Mental manipulation of numeric information to perform oral arithmetic: wnl (ss = 11).
- Visual Search and Attention: Coding (ss = 8), Symbol Search (ss = 9), and TMT-A (25 seconds), wnl.

### Executive Functions 

Although many aspects of executive functioning were within normal limits, she demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and hypothesis testing.
- Simple, timed cognitive flexibility: TMT-B (50 seconds), wnl.
- Controlled behavioral inhibition: SCWT, wnl (CW T = 53).
- Cognitive flexibility, novel problem solving, and hypothesis testing: WCST-64, below expectations for this patient (two categories); error pattern suggested inefficient problem solving and use of feedback to modify responding.
- Verbal abstract reasoning: Similarities, wnl (ss = 11).
- Visual analogical reasoning: Matrix Reasoning, strong (ss = 16).
- Behavioral initiation and fluency: Verbal fluency (FAS raw = 45), wnl. Nonverbal fluency, wnl (z = â€“0.6).
