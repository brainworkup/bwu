  abstract     = {Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) identifies emotion dysregulation as central to the dangerous impulsivity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) including substance use disorders, and DBT targets improved emotion regulation as a primary mechanism of change. However, improved emotion regulation with DBT and associations between such improvement and behavioral outcomes such as substance use has not been previously reported. Objective: Thus, the goal of this study was to assess for improvement in emotion regulation and to examine the relationship between improvements in the emotion regulation and substance use problems following DBT treatment. Method: Emotion regulation as assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, depressed mood as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, and their associations with substance use frequency were investigated in 27 women with substance dependence and BPD receiving 20 weeks of DBT in an academic community outpatient substance abuse treatment program. Results: Results indicated improved emotion regulation, improved mood, and decreased substance use frequency. Further, emotion regulation improvement, but not improved mood, explained the variance of decreased substance use frequency. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: This is the first study to demonstrate improved emotion regulation in BPD patients treated with DBT and to show that improved emotion regulation can account for increased behavioral control in BPD patients. Significance and future research: Emotion regulation assessment is recommended for future studies to further clarify the etiology and maintenance of disorders associated with emotional dysregulation such as BPD and substance dependence and to further explore emotion regulation as a potential mechanism of change for clinical interventions.},

  abstract     = {Background Late-preterm (LPT) birth accounts for a majority of
                  preterm deliveries and until recently was considered low risk for
                  poor cognitive outcome. Previously, we reported deficits in
                  complicated LPT (cLPT) preschoolers (neonatal intensive care unit
                  [NICU]-admitted). Aim To extend our prior study by comparing
                  cognitive outcome in cLPT and uncomplicated LPT (uLPT; NICU
                  non-admitted) preschoolers. Study design Single center
                  retrospective cohort study of 118 LPT children born in 2004
                  \textendash 2006 at 35\textendash 36weeks of gestation; 90 cLPT and
                  28 uLPT, compared with 100 term-born ({$\geq$}37weeks of gestation
                  and {$\geq$}2500g) participants. Outcome measure A
                  well-standardized measure of general conceptual ability (GCA), the
                  Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition. Results cLPT
                  participants had average mean performances but significantly poorer
                  GCA, Nonverbal Reasoning, and Spatial scores than term-born
                  children, and higher rates of Nonverbal Reasoning and Spatial
                  impairment; uLPT did not differ from TERM. Combined LPT males were
                  at eightfold greater risk than term-born males for nonverbal
                  deficit, and at sevenfold greater risk for GCA impairment than LPT
                  females. Conclusions Finding greater risk of cognitive deficit in
                  those NICU-admitted due to clinical instability or birth weight {
                  $<$}2kg compared with non-admitted preschoolers indicates that
                  neonatal morbidities contribute to subtle cognitive deficits
                  detectable at young age, with male gender an additive risk factor.
                  LPT gestational age alone is an insufficient predictor of long-term
                  neurocognitive outcome. Further study should elucidate salient
                  etiologies for early emerging cognitive weaknesses and suggest
                  appropriate interventions to prepare at-risk LPT preschoolers for
                  elementary school entry.},

@article{baumCommunicationKeyUtility2018,
  abstract   = {Objective: The neuropsychological report is a critical tool for
                communicating evaluation results to multiple audiences who have
                varying knowledge about neuropsychology and often have limited
                ability to review long, complex reports. Considerable time is spent
                writing these reports and challenges persist related to readability
                , length/complexity, and billable clinical time (which may be
                capped by third-party payors or families' ability to pay). Methods:
                This quality improvement effort systematically evaluated the
                redesign of pediatric neuropsychological reports in an outpatient
                clinic serving primarily medical populations. Results: Revised
                reports were shorter, with improved readability, structure, and
                effectiveness in communicating results and recommendations.
                Improved clinical efficiency was also observed. Conclusions: We
                suggest that adaptation to efficient, readable, and effective
                reports is possible within the practice of neuropsychology.
                Findings encourage replication in other settings. Through
                collaboration with key stakeholders, providers can identify their
                populations' and audience's unique needs and set report targets
                accordingly. To encourage that practice, we summarize our general
                process, provide a set of guidelines that can be adapted across
                multiple settings, and include an appended sample report. },

  abstract     = {The Driving Scenes test of the new Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB; [Stern, R.A.,  \&amp; White, T. (2003a). Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. Lutz, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.]) measures several aspects of visual attention thought to be important for driving ability. The current study examined the relationship between scores on the Driving Scenes test and on-road driving performance on a standardized driving test. Healthy participants performed significantly better on the Driving Scenes test than did very mildly demented participants. A correlation of 0.55 was found between the brief, office-based Driving Scenes test and the 108-point on-road driving score. Furthermore, the Driving Scenes test scores differed significantly across the driving instructor's three global ratings (safe, marginal, and unsafe), and results of a discriminant function analysis indicated that the Driving Scenes test correctly classified 66 \% of participants into these groups. Thus, the new NAB Driving Scenes test appears to have good ecological validity for real-world driving ability in normal and very mildly demented older adults.},

  abstract     = {Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a major public health problem. Research has demonstrated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience MVCs, but the effect of ADHD medication treatment on the risk of MVCs remains unclear.To explore associations between ADHD medication use and risk of MVCs in a large cohort of patients with ADHD.For this study, a US national cohort of patients with ADHD (n = 2 319 450) was identified from commercial health insurance claims between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, and followed up for emergency department visits for MVCs. The study used within-individual analyses to compare the risk of MVCs during months in which patients received ADHD medication with the risk of MVCs during months in which they did not receive ADHD medication.Dispensed prescription of ADHD medications.Emergency department visits for MVCs.Among 2 319 450 patients identified with ADHD, the mean (SD) age was 32.5 (12.8) years, and 51.7 \% were female. In the within-individual analyses, male patients with ADHD had a 38 \% (odds ratio, 0.62; 95 \% CI, 0.56-0.67) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication compared with months when not receiving medication, and female patients had a 42 \% (odds ratio, 0.58; 95 \% CI, 0.53-0.62) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication. Similar reductions were found across all age groups, across multiple sensitivity analyses, and when considering the long-term association between ADHD medication use and MVCs. Estimates of the population-attributable fraction suggested that up to 22.1 \% of the MVCs in patients with ADHD could have been avoided if they had received medication during the entire follow-up.Among patients with ADHD, rates of MVCs were lower during periods when they received ADHD medication. Considering the high prevalence of ADHD and its association with MVCs, these findings warrant attention to this prevalent and preventable cause of mortality and morbidity.},

A slight lapse in attention or inhibition while driving (not uncommon in individuals with ADHD) can result in hazardous consequences for these individuals and their families. This is also an interesting clinical scenario for the treating physician, who is always trying to optimize the various treatment options for the patient. Despite such potentially perilous consequences for society, this subject only recently has received researchers' attention. This review paper highlights the psychological differences between drivers with and without ADHD and examines differences between these groups in various driving simulation models. Research updates involving pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are discussed at length. Although the long-term effects of such interventions may not be clearly defined, there is enough evidence to suggest the public health significance of such interventions for optimally managing adult symptoms of ADHD.},

Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3\% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples.

In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.},

                  for individuals with multiple and severe psychosocial disorders,
                  including those who are chronically suicidal. Because many such
                  patients have substance use disorders (SUDs), the authors developed
                  DBT for Substance Abusers, which incorporates concepts and

                  abstinence, "clear mind," and attachment strategies that include
                  off-site counseling as well as active attempts to find patients who

                  DBT for Substance Abusers decreased substance abuse in patients

  abstract     = {Objectives: Descriptive labels of performance test scores are a critical component of communicating outcomes of neuropsychological and psychological evaluations. Yet, no universally accepted system exists for assigning qualitative descriptors to scores in specific ranges. In addition, the definition and use of the term ``impairment'' lacks specificity and consensus. Consequently, test score labels and the denotation of impairment are inconsistently applied by clinicians, creating confusion among consumers of neuropsychological services, including referral sources, trainees, colleagues, and the judicial system. To reduce this confusion, experts in clinical and forensic neuropsychological and psychological assessment convened in a consensus conference at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN). The goals of the consensus conference were to recommend (1) a system of qualitative labels to describe results from performance-based tests with normal and non-normal distributions and (2) a definition of impairment and its application in individual case determinations.},

@article{HalperinTrampush2008,
  abstract     = {Background: This study examined neuropsychological functioning in
                  a longitudinal sample of adolescents/young adults with attention
                  deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls as a function of
                  the persistence of ADHD. We hypothesized that measures of executive
                  processes would parallel adolescent clinical status, with
                  ADHD-persisters, but not remitters, differing significantly from
                  controls. In contrast, persisters and remitters were hypothesized
                  to perform similarly, and different from controls, on tasks
                  requiring less effortful processing. Methods: Ninety-eight
                  participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated
                  approximately 10 years later. Eighty-five never-ADHD controls
                  similar in age, IQ, and sex distribution served as a comparison
                  group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and
                  neuropsychological test battery. Results: Those with childhood ADHD
                  demonstrated broad neuropsychological deficits relative to
                  controls. When the group with childhood ADHD was subdivided based
                  on adolescent ADHD status, compared to controls, both persisters
                  and remitters showed deficient perceptual sensitivity and response
                  variability, and increased ankle movements recorded by a
                  solid-state actigraph. Only persisters differed from controls on
                  several measures of more effortful executive processes.
                  Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary support to the hypothesis
                  that ADHD is associated with early-appearing and enduring
                  subcortical dysfunction, while recovery over the course of
                  development is associated with improvements in executive control

                  assessed, but there is little consensus on how it should be

                  associated with establishing standard operational definitions of
                  executive functioning, the National Institute of Neurological
                  Disorders and Stroke entered into a contract with the University of
                  California-San Francisco to develop psychometrically robust
                  executive measurement tools that would be accepted by the neurology
                  clinical trials and clinical research communities. This effort,
                  entitled Executive Abilities: Measures and Instruments for
                  Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Research ({EXAMINER}), resulted in a

  abstract     = {Here, we present a large (n = 107,207) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of general cognitive ability (``g''), further enhanced by combining results with a large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic loci associated with general cognitive ability. Results showed significant enrichment for genes causing Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability phenotype. Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions (most strongly in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic correlations between cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including psychiatric disorders, several autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at first birth.

  abstract     = {Susceptibility to schizophrenia is inversely correlated with general cognitive ability at both the phenotypic and the genetic level. Paradoxically, a modest but consistent positive genetic correlation has been reported between schizophrenia and educational attainment, despite the strong positive genetic correlation between cognitive ability and educational attainment. Here we leverage published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia to parse biological mechanisms underlying these results. Association analysis based on subsets (ASSET), a pleiotropic meta-analytic technique, allowed jointly associated loci to be identified and characterized. Specifically, we identified subsets of variants associated in the expected ("concordant") direction across all three phenotypes (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia, lower cognitive ability, and lower educational attainment); these were contrasted with variants that demonstrated the counterintuitive ("discordant") relationship between education and schizophrenia (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia and higher educational attainment). ASSET analysis revealed 235 independent loci associated with cognitive ability, education, and/or schizophrenia at p \textbackslash textless 5 \texttimes{} 10-8. Pleiotropic analysis successfully identified more than 100 loci that were not significant in the input GWASs. Many of these have been validated by larger, more recent single-phenotype GWASs. Leveraging the joint genetic correlations of cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia, we were able to dissociate two distinct biological mechanisms-early neurodevelopmental pathways that characterize concordant allelic variation and adulthood synaptic pruning pathways-that were linked to the paradoxical positive genetic association between education and schizophrenia. Furthermore, genetic correlation analyses revealed that these mechanisms contribute not only to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia but also to the broader biological dimensions implicated in both general health outcomes and psychiatric illness.},

  abstract     = {Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3\% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11\textendash 13\% of the variance in educational attainment and 7\textendash 10\% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.},

@article{levyMinimalBrainDysfunction1976,
  abstract     = {Minimal brain dysfunction is a neurodevelopmental disorder which
                  can be found in nearly 20\% of school children. It is characterized
                  by evidences of immaturity involving control of activity, emotions,
                  and behavior, and by specific learning disabilities involving the
                  communicating skills needed in reading, writing, and mathematics.
                  The prime deficits in the classroom are an inability to maintain
                  attention and concentration and an inability to skillfully blend
                  the auditory and visual functions essential in language
                  performance. Medical evaluation will reveal many of the "soft signs
                  " of neurologic involvement, and educational appraisal will
                  indicate a wide scatter in testing scores with a marked discrepancy
                  between evaluated potential and actual classroom achievement.
                  Remedial efforts directed at early detection, relief from pressure
                  and unjust punishment or ridicule from parents and teachers, and
                  adjustment of the educational environment with consideration of the
                  child's individual talents, combined with the judicious use of
                  medications to prolong attention span and improve
                  neurodevelopmental maturity, hold promise of improving the lot of
                  most involved children. There are valid indications that expansion
                  of such programs can do much to prevent these youngsters from
                  developing severe personality maladjustment and delinquent behavior
                  , as well as emotional illness in later life.},

               that creatively combine the best elements of behavioral,
               psychoanalytic, strategic, and other commonly employed modalities.
               The first section of the book presents an overview of the disorder
               and lays out a theoretical framework to guide the therapy. The
               second describes in detail how to assess borderline patients and
               how to organize and prioritize treatment goals and behavioral
               targets. . . . For problem solving with borderline personality
               disorder, the book provides specific strategies for contingency
               management, exposure, cognitive modification, and skills training.
               The last component is further elucidated in the companion "Skills
               Training Manual." Addressing the most stressful patient behaviors
               that clinicians encounter, the book includes a step-by-step outline
               for assessing suicide risk, managing suicide threats, and working
               with chronic suicidal behavior. Integrative approaches for such
               specific problems as crises, noncompliance, and breakdowns in the
               therapeutic relationship are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract     = {Previous research finds that self-control is positively associated
                  with adaptive and negatively associated with maladaptive behavior.
                  However, most previous studies use cross-sectional designs,
                  low-risk samples, and limited assessments of self-control. This
                  study of 553 jail inmates examined the relationship of a valid
                  measure of self-control (Brief Self-Control Scale) completed on
                  incarceration with behavior before, during, and 1 year after
                  incarceration. After controlling for positive impression management
                  (PIM), self-control was negatively related to substance misuse,
                  suicidality, risky sex, and criminal history prior to incarceration
                  and post-release illegal substance misuse, recidivism, and positive
                  adjustment. Lower self-control predicted increases in substance
                  dependence at post-release compared with pre-incarceration.
                  Self-control was not related to misbehavior during incarceration,
                  nor alcohol use or HIV-risk behavior 1 year post-release. Results
                  were consistent as a function of age, race, and gender. This study

  abstract     = {Those involved in the criminal justice system are swiftly
                  identified as "criminals." Receipt of this label may promote
                  self-stigma, a process wherein criminal stereotypes are
                  internalized and produce negative psychological and behavioral
                  consequences. Research has yet to identify which types of offenders
                  are at risk for, or in contrast, protected from, experiencing
                  self-stigma. The current study examines whether risk and protective
                  factors predict multiple components of the self-stigma process
                  (i.e., perceived stigma, stereotype agreement, internalized stigma,
                  anticipated stigma) in a sample of male jail inmates (N = 111).
                  Results showed that mental health symptoms were a consistent risk
                  factor across three of four self-stigma components, whereas
                  antisocial characteristics were a risk factor for stereotype
                  agreement and internalized stigma. Self-esteem was a protective
                  factor for internalized and anticipated stigma. Implications for
                  preventing self-stigma among offenders are discussed.},

                  solution-oriented research questions about the links between
                  children's early life environment and their risks of pre-, peri-,
                  and post-natal complications, asthma, obesity, neurodevelopmental
                  disorders, and positive health. Children born very preterm are at
                  increased risk for many of the outcomes on which ECHO focuses, but
                  the contributions of environmental factors to this risk are not
                  well characterized. Three ECHO cohorts consist almost exclusively
                  of individuals born very preterm. Data provided to ECHO from
                  cohorts can be used to address hypotheses about (1) differential
                  risks of chronic health and developmental conditions between
                  individuals born very preterm and those born at term; (2) health

Path analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and questionnaires about ADHD traits and traffic crashes over the past decade revealed significant correlations of ADHD traits with different brain regions relevant to different cognitive functions. The left precuneus responsible for visuospatial cognition was the sole region correlated with all ADHD trait categories, suggesting it plays an important role in understanding driving safety and traffic crashes. For the first time, a strong relationship was found among regional GMVs, ADHD traits, and real-life traffic crashes. These insights into the complex interplay may inform the development of an effective intervention with MRI examination to prevent traffic crashes. Large-scale brain volumetric data may further open social applications of behaviour science and neuroimaging.},

@article{roberton2015,
  abstract     = {Objective: The influence of anger experience, expression, and
                  control on aggressive behavior has been the focus of much
                  theoretical and empirical attention. The influence of other
                  emotions and emotional processing facets on aggression has received
                  less consideration. This study sought to determine whether failing
                  to attend to upsetting emotions, including anger, is associated
                  with aggression, beyond the effects of poor anger control. Method:
                  Participants (n = 64) were criminal offenders who were mandated to
                  attend Community Corrections Offices across Melbourne, Australia.
                  Participants completed measures of anger experience, expression and
                  control, attention to emotions, past aggression, and verbal
                  intelligence. Results: Results indicate that participants reporting
                  difficulty attending to their emotions had more extensive histories
                  of aggression than those who did not report such difficulties. This
                  relationship remained significant even after controlling for trait
                  anger and the ability to control the outward expression of anger.
                  Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of current
                  approaches to violent offender treatment. In particular, it is
                  recommended that intervention programs should seek to emphasize the
                  importance of controlling aggressive behavior in the face of anger,
                  while attending to (rather than avoiding or suppressing) the anger
                  experience itself. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

  abstract     = {\textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s). Intelligence is highly heritable1and a major determinant of human health and well-being2. Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence3-7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n = 269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer's disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Objective Rapid, clear and efficient communication of
              neuropsychological results is essential to benefit patient care.
              Errors in communication are a lead cause of medical errors;
              nevertheless, there remains a lack of consistency in how
              neuropsychological scores are communicated. A major limitation in
              the communication of neuropsychological results is the inconsistent
              use of qualitative descriptors for standardized test scores and the
              use of vague terminology. Patients and methods PubMed search from 1
              Jan 2007 to 1 Aug 2016 to identify guidelines or consensus
              statements for the description and reporting of qualitative terms
              to communicate neuropsychological test scores was conducted. The
              review found the use of confusing and overlapping terms to describe
              various ranges of percentile standardized test scores. Results In
              response, we propose a simplified set of qualitative descriptors
              for normalized test scores (Q-Simple) as a means to reduce errors
              in communicating test results. The Q-Simple qualitative terms are:
              ‘very superior’, ‘superior’, ‘High Average’, ‘average’, ‘low
              average’, ‘borderline’ and ‘abnormal/impaired’. A case example
              illustrates the proposed Q-Simple qualitative classification system
              to communicate neuropsychological results for neurosurgical
              planning. Conclusions The Q-Simple qualitative descriptor system is
              aimed as a means to improve and standardize communication of
              standardized neuropsychological test scores. Research are needed to
              further evaluate neuropsychological communication errors. Conveying
              the clinical implications of neuropsychological results in a manner
              that minimizes risk for communication errors is a quintessential
              component of evidence-based practice.},

Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the minor T allele of a common polymorphism (rs10174400) in SCN2A is associated with significantly higher "g" independent of gender and age. We further demonstrate using resting-state fMRI data from our discovery cohort (n = 236) that this genetic advantage may be mediated by increased capacity for information processing between the dorsolateral pFC and dorsal ACC, which support higher cognitive functions. Collectively, these findings fill a gap in our understanding of the genetics of general cognitive ability and highlight a specific neural mechanism through which a common polymorphism shapes interindividual variation in "g."},

  abstract     = {Predictors of math achievement in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are not well-known. To address this gap in the literature, we examined individual differences in neurocognitive functioning domains on math computation in a cross-sectional sample of youth with ADHD. Gender and anxiety symptoms were explored as potential moderators. The sample consisted of 281 youth (aged 8\textendash 15 years) diagnosed with ADHD. Neurocognitive tasks assessed auditory-verbal working memory, visuospatial working memory, and processing speed. Auditory-verbal working memory speed significantly predicted math computation. A three-way interaction revealed that at low levels of anxious perfectionism, slower processing speed predicted poorer math computation for boys compared to girls. These findings indicate the uniquely predictive values of auditory-verbal working memory and processing speed on math computation, and their differential moderation. These findings provide preliminary support that gender and anxious perfectionism may influence the relationship between neurocognitive functioning and academic achievement.},

In an attempt to overcome these barriers, the current study utilized GWAS meta-analysis to examine the association of common genetic variation ({$\sim$}8M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with minor allele frequency {$\geqslant$} 1\%) to general cognitive function in a sample of 35 298 healthy individuals of European ancestry across 24 cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT). In addition, we utilized individual SNP lookups and polygenic score analyses to identify genetic overlap with other relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes. Our primary GWAS meta-analysis identified two novel SNP loci (top SNPs: rs76114856 in the CENPO gene on chromosome 2 and rs6669072 near LOC105378853 on chromosome 1) associated with cognitive performance at the genome-wide significance level (P o 5 \texttimes{} 10 - 8},

  abstract     = {Cognitive deficits and reduced educational achievement are common in psychiatric illness; understanding the genetic basis of cognitive and educational deficits may be informative about the etiology of psychiatric disorders. A recent, large genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported a genome-wide significant locus for years of education, which subsequently demonstrated association to general cognitive ability ("g") in overlapping cohorts. The current study was designed to test whether GWAS hits for educational attainment are involved in general cognitive ability in an independent, large-scale collection of cohorts. Using cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT; up to 20,495 healthy individuals), we examined the relationship between g and variants associated with educational attainment. We next conducted meta-analyses with 24,189 individuals with neurocognitive data from the educational attainment studies, and then with 53,188 largely independent individuals from a recent GWAS of cognition. A SNP (rs1906252) located at chromosome 6q16.1, previously associated with years of schooling, was significantly associated with g (P = 1.47 \texttimes{} 10(-4) ) in COGENT. The first joint analysis of 43,381 non-overlapping individuals for this a priori-designated locus was strongly significant (P = 4.94 \texttimes{} 10(-7) ), and the second joint analysis of 68,159 non-overlapping individuals was even more robust (P = 1.65 \texttimes{} 10(-9) ). These results provide independent replication, in a large-scale dataset, of a genetic locus associated with cognitive function and education. As sample sizes grow, cognitive GWAS will identify increasing numbers of associated loci, as has been accomplished in other polygenic quantitative traits, which may be relevant to psychiatric illness.},

  abstract     = {We tested the hypothesis that dopamine D1 and D2 receptor gene (DRD1 and DRD2, respectively) polymorphisms and the development of working memory skills can interact to influence symptom change over 10 years in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Specifically, we examined whether improvements in working memory maintenance and manipulation from childhood to early adulthood predicted the reduction of ADHD symptoms as a function of allelic variation in DRD1 and DRD2. Participants were 76 7-11-year-old children with ADHD who were genotyped and prospectively followed for almost 10 years. ADHD symptoms were rated using the Attention Problems scale on the Child Behavior Checklist, and verbal working memory maintenance and manipulation, measured by Digit Span forward and backward, respectively, were assessed at baseline and follow-up. After correction for multiple testing, improvements in working memory manipulation, not maintenance, predicted reduction of symptomatology over development and was moderated by major allele homozygosity in two DRD1 polymorphisms (rs4532 and rs265978) previously linked with variation in D1 receptor expression. Depending on genetic background, developmental factors including age-dependent variation in DRD1 penetrance may facilitate the link between improvements in higher-order working memory and the remission of symptoms in individuals with childhood-diagnosed ADHD. Furthermore, the current findings suggest that DRD1 might contribute minimally to the emergence of symptoms and cognitive difficulties associated with ADHD in childhood, but may act as a modifier gene of these clinical features and outcome during later development for those with ADHD.},

  abstract     = {First-episode schizophrenia (FES) spectrum disorders are associated with pronounced cognitive dysfunction across all domains. However, less is known about the course of cognitive functioning, following the first presentation of psychosis, and the relationship of cognition to clinical course during initial treatment. The present longitudinal study examined the magnitude of neurocognitive impairment, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis at baseline and after 12 weeks of randomized antipsychotic treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone. At baseline, FES patients evidenced marked impairments in cognitive functioning. Notably, performance on the mazes task of planning and reasoning significantly predicted the likelihood of meeting stringent criteria for positive symptom remission during the first 12 weeks of the trial. Performance on indices of general cognitive function, working memory, and verbal learning improved over time, but these improvements were mediated by improvements in both positive and negative symptoms. We did not detect any differential effects of antipsychotic medication assignment (aripiprazole vs risperidone) on cognitive functioning. Our results suggest that a brief paper-and-pencil measure reflecting planning/reasoning abilities may index responsivity to antipsychotic medication. However, improvements in cognitive functioning over time were related to clinical symptom improvement, reflecting "pseudospecificity."},

  abstract     = {Abstract Purpose To describe the content and potentials of the new Swedish national register on prescribed and dispensed medicines. Methods The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information about age, sex and unique identifier of the patient as well as the prescriber's profession and practice. Information regarding drug utilization and expenditures for prescribed drugs in the entire Swedish population was extracted from the first six months July\textendash December 2005 and compared with total drug sales in the country including OTC and hospital use. Results The total quantity of drugs sold in Sweden was 2666 million DDDs, corresponding to 1608 DDD/1000 inhabitants daily. The total expenditures were 1.6 billion Euro. The prescribed drugs, included in the register, accounted for 84\% of the total utilization and 77\% of the total expenditures. About half of all men and two-thirds of all women in the country purchased drugs. The proportion increased by age. The most common drugs for chronic treatment were diuretics among women (8.8\% of the population) and antithrombotic agents among men (7.6\%). Psychotropic drugs, corticosteroids and analgesics were more common among women, while men used antithrombotic agents, antidiabetic drugs, lipid lowering agents and ACE inhibitors to a greater extent. Conclusions The new register provides valuable data on exposure to drugs and is useful to study patterns of drug utilization. The possibilities for record linkage to other health registers gives from an international perspective good opportunities to explore drug and disease associations and the risks, benefits, effectiveness and health economical effects of drug use.
