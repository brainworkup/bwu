<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to academic
achievement (reading, writing, math). For scores that are
below average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that
are above average to below average to delineate relative strengths and
weaknesses, respectively.
