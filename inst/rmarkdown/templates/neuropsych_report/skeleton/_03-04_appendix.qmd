## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are intrinsically performance-based, and cognitive performance assessed during this neuropsychological evaluation is summarized above.
Where appropriate, qualitative observations are included.
Cultural considerations were made when selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations.
Results from formal tests are reported in comparison to other individuals the same age, sex, and educational level as range of functioning (e.g., below average, average, above average).
Test score labels are intended solely to be descriptive, identifying positions of scores relative to a normal curve distribution, and should be interpreted within the context of the patient's individual presentation and history.
Although standardized scores provide the clinician with an important and necessary understanding of the patient's test performance compared with a normative group, they do not on their own lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Test Score Distributions

[@fig-gauss-plot-narrow] can be used as a guide to help interpret individual test scores in terms of the degree of distance a score fell in relation to normative expectations and the magnitude of clinical severity. Test scores are easiest to interpret as percentiles[^1] and as *z*-Scores (M = 0, SD = 1)[^2], which are used to plot the various test and domain scores below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gauss-plot-narrow
#| fig-cap: "Classification of neuropsychological test scores that are normally distributed in the general population [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]."
#| fig-retina: 2
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.67
#| fig-show: hold
#| out-height: 50%

[^1]: A *percentile* shows `r params$first_name`'s standing relative to peers. For example, a percentile rank of 70 means `r params$first_name` performed as well as or better than 70% of individuals the same age.

[^2]: *z* = -1 (16th percentile), *z* = 0 (50th percentile), and *z* = 1 (84th percentile)
