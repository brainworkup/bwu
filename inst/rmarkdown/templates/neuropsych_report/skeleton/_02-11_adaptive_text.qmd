<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to adaptive functioning. Adaptive functioning is a broad term that refers to the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that enable individuals to function independently and meet the demands of everyday life. These skills include things like communication, self-care, home living, social skills, and community use.

For scores that are Below Average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are Above Average to Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.

<<EXAMPLE>>

`r params$first_name`'s adaptive functioning in everyday situations was examined. Their current overall level of adaptive behavior is in the Mildly Impaired range, as high as or higher than 4% of adults of the same age. Adaptive skill areas within the Conceptual domain were in the Mildly Impaired range, with below average to impaired scores in communication (including speech, listening, conversation, and nonverbal communication skills), functional academics (performing basic pre-academic skills that form the foundations of higher-level reading, writing, and mathematics), and self-direction (ability to make independent choices, exhibit self-control, and take responsibility when appropriate). `r params$first_name`'s specific skill sets within the Social domain were rated as being an area of concern as well. For example, they do not witness First use free time during the school day productively or interactively very often, nor engage in play and recreational activities for fun. They are also concerned about their ability to interact socially, initiate and maintain friendships, and express and recognize emotions. Lastly, `r params$first_name`'s level of functioning in a classroom setting, including maintenance of school property and taking care of personal possessions was also rated an area of difficulty for them.
