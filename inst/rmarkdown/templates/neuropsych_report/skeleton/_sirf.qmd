## Summary and Formulation 

XXXX is a 28-year-old left-handed female with a history of medically refractory epilepsy who was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive presurgical work-up. General cognitive ability is well within normal limits, and there is no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates. No deficits were detected in the domains of attention, processing speed, motor functioning, or visuospatial skills. Although many aspects of executive functioning, language functioning, and memory were within normal limits, she demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and hypothesis testing, weaknesses in word retrieval, and inefficiency in new learning of verbal information. There is no evidence of a mood disorder at this time.

In conclusion, the cognitive profile is mildly localizing and lateralizing as there are elements that suggest relative left temporal involvement. That said, there were features seen during testing that suggested mild frontal systems disruption as well.
Although Ms. XXXX lives alone, she has arranged to have her mother stay with her for a week or two after surgery to help her and provide support in the immediate postacute period. She seems to have a good understanding of and appropriate expectations for the surgery. Taken together with her current asymptomatic mood profile, there are no obvious psychological risk factors for a poor outcome or need for presurgical mental health intervention.

## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

Biggie was administered a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The results of the assessment revealed that Biggie has a significant learning disability in reading. He also has mild deficits in attention and working memory. Biggie's overall cognitive functioning is in the average range.

Overall, these findings suggest that Mr. Smalls's cognitive functioning is
generally intact and within normal limits. While he may not excel in all areas,
he does not show any significant cognitive impairments that would interfere with
his daily life activities.

Mr. Smalls has significant difficulties with reading. His sight vocabulary fluency, word-level and text-level reading skills, single word decoding, reading comprehension skills, decontextualized phonic decoding, and risk for dyslexia are all below average. Additionally, his phonic decoding skills and fluency are exceptionally low. These impairments can lead to difficulties in understanding written language, comprehending complex texts, recognizing unfamiliar words, understanding the main idea of a text, making inferences, and decoding words accurately and rapidly.
