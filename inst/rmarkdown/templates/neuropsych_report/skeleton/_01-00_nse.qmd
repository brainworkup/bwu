## Referral

`r params$first_name` was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive work-up for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results and recommendations were discussed with `r params$first_name` during the feedback visit on the final day of the evaluation and will be used in academic and treatment planning.

## Background

The following information was obtained during an interview with `r params$patient` and from review of available medical records.
`r params$first_name` has been doing well in `r params$his_her` classes since starting law school and has never failed.
However, issues have begun to arise that `r params$he_she` has been unable to avoid, including being easily distracted, restlessness, constantly fidgeting, procrastination, and variable attention.
`r params$he_she_cap` suspects having ADHD and has always struggled with aspects of it.
`r params$first_name`'s mother tried to get `r params$his_her` evaluated and tested when `r params$he_she` was younger, but was never able to do so because `r params$his_her` school at the time did not agree that there were major concerns.
`r params$he_she_cap` has noticed increasing difficulty initiating tasks, especially when it comes to writing long research papers, and has been procrastinating more and more.
`r params$first_name` has read up on ADHD and believes `r params$he_she` may have it, but has been able to hide it from others, as `r params$he_she` has "gotten good at pretending to pay attention." `r params$he_she_cap` seeks further assessment and evaluation to identify any underlying neurocognitive factors influencing `r params$his_her` academic motivations and performance.

Cognitive complaints: sustained attention, working memory, and organization.

### Educational History

Attended a PS 198 school with an emphasis in social-emotional development and had no significant academic difficulties in the past.
However, if `r params$first_name` found a task uninteresting or disliked it, `r params$he_she` would simply not complete it.
This led `r params$his_her` teachers to believe `r params$he_she` was incapable of the task when in reality, `r params$his_her` lack of motivation stemmed from a lack of interest.
It was always difficult for `r params$his_her` to take notes and still is; a traditional classroom setting would have further exacerbated `r params$his_her` difficulties in note-taking.
