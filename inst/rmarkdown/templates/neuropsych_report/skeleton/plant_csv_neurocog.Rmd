## Calculate CI 95%

```{r ci, echo = TRUE}

scale_rel <- as.numeric(params$reliability)

data$ci_95 <- paste0(data$ci_lo, " - ", data$ci_hi)
```

```{r}
data <- data |> dplyr::select(-.z)
```

## Relocate variables

```{r, eval = T}
data <- data |> relocate(c(raw_score, score, ci_95, percentile, range, test, test_name, domain, subdomain, narrow, pass, verbal, timed, test_type, score_type, description, result, absort, true_score, ci_lo, ci_hi), .after = scale)
```

## Write csv files

```{r writeout-scale}
table <- data
test <- table$test
scale <- snakecase::to_snake_case(table$scale)
file_path <- here::here("pre_csv", paste0(test, "_", scale, ".csv"))
readr::write_excel_csv(
  table,
  file_path,
  append = FALSE,
  col_names = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
has_headers <- function(file_path) {
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
    return(FALSE) # File doesn't exist, headers are needed
  }
  # Check if the file has at least one line (header)
  return(length(readLines(file_path, n = 1)) > 0)
}
```

```{r writeout-test}
table <- data
test <- table$test
file_path <- here::here("csv", paste0(test, ".csv"))

readr::write_excel_csv(
  table,
  file_path,
  append = TRUE,
  col_names = !has_headers(file_path)
)
```

```{r writeout-g}
table <- data
test <- "g2"
file_path <- here::here("csv", paste0(test, ".csv"))

readr::write_excel_csv(
  table,
  file_path,
