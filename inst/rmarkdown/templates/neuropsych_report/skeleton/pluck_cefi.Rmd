## Patient

```{r patient}
patient <- params$patient
```

## Test

Name of neuropsych test or rating scale.

```{r test}
test <- params$test
test_name <- params$test_name
```

## Load PDF file and save as file.path

```{r file}
# file <- file.choose()
file <- file.path(params$file)
```

## Pages

```{r pages}
pages <- params$pages
```

## Write/Read PDF file.path

```{r write-file}

# If need to read file directly
# file <- readLines(here::here(patient, "pre_csv", paste0(test, ".pdf")))

# Tidy Tables

## CEFI Full Scale

### Table 1 using base R

```{r}

# Convert columns to double
to_double <- c("score", "percentile")

# Add 'scale' column
df1 <- transform(df1, scale = "")
df1 <- df1[c("scale", "score", "ci_95", "percentile", "category")]
```

```{r}
# Modify 'score' value based on params$test
if (params$test == "cefi_sr") {
  df1[1, "scale"] <- "CEFI-SR Full Scale"

## CEFI Subscales

```{r}

# Convert columns to double
to_double <- c("score", "percentile", "diff_from_avg")
df2[to_double] <- lapply(df2[to_double], as.numeric)
```

```{r}

## Select variables to keep

```{r select}

# Mutate Table Columns
