title: "Sample Neuropsychology Consultation Report "
---

For illustrative purposes, this sample report includes an amalgamation of medical/psychosocial histories and score profiles commonly seen in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (the most common form of epilepsy) and is not reflective of the history and data from a particular patient.

## Referral

Ms. XXXX was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive presurgical work-up of her epilepsy syndrome. The results will be used in surgical and treatment planning

## Background

The following information was obtained during an interview with Ms. XXXX and from review of available medical records. Ms. XXXX has a history of seizures since age 14. While they were initially well controlled, in the last 3 years they have become refractory to multiple seizure medications. She currently experiences one to two seizures per week. Seizures are characterized by behavioral and speech arrest, and last approximately 2 minutes. Postictally, she is mildly confused with language disruption, but she returns to baseline in approximately 10 minutes. She is treated with Depakote, Keppra, and Lamictal.

Cognitive complaints: mild memory and word-finding issues over the last 2 years.

- Cognitive process: Coherent and goal directed.
- Motivation/effort: Normal.

## Tests Administered 

Wechsler Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF); Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV (WAIS-IV); Wechsler Memory Scale–IV, select subtests; Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT); Rey Complex Figure Test; Verbal Fluency tasks; Boston Naming Test (BNT); Trail Making Test (TMT); Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT); Wisconsin Card Sorting Test–64 item (WCST-64); Ruff Figural Fluency Test; Grooved Pegboard Test; Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II); Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–II–Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF).

## Test Results 

### General Intellectual Functioning 

Normal general intellectual functioning with no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates.
- Premorbid estimate: TOPF, above average (SS = 112).
- Current general cognitive ability: VCI = 103; PRI = 117; WMI = 102; PSI = 92. All domains wnl; strong perceptual reasoning abilities.

### Attention and Processing Speed 

No deficits identified.
- Auditory Attention Span: 6 forward, wnl.
- Verbal Working Memory: 5 digits reversed and 6 digits sequenced,wnl.
- Mental manipulation of numeric information to perform oral arithmetic: wnl (ss = 11).
- Visual Search and Attention: Coding (ss = 8), Symbol Search (ss = 9), and TMT-A (25 seconds), wnl.

### Executive Functions 

Although many aspects of executive functioning were within normal limits, she demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and hypothesis testing.
- Simple, timed cognitive flexibility: TMT-B (50 seconds), wnl.
- Controlled behavioral inhibition: SCWT, wnl (CW T = 53).
- Cognitive flexibility, novel problem solving, and hypothesis testing: WCST-64, below expectations for this patient (two categories); error pattern suggested inefficient problem solving and use of feedback to modify responding.
- Verbal abstract reasoning: Similarities, wnl (ss = 11).
- Visual analogical reasoning: Matrix Reasoning, strong (ss = 16).
- Behavioral initiation and fluency: Verbal fluency (FAS raw = 45), wnl. Nonverbal fluency, wnl (z = –0.6).

### Motor 
No gross impairments detected.
- Dominant left hand: low average (66 seconds).
- Nondominant right hand: wnl (67 seconds).

### Language Functions

While many areas of language functioning were within normal limits, Ms. XXXX demonstrated a weakness in aspects of word retrieval.

- Auditory comprehension: Able to respond appropriately to interview questions and follow test instructions without difficulty.
- Expressive vocabulary: Vocabulary, wnl (ss = 10).
- Fund of verbal semantic knowledge: Information, wnl (ss = 11).
- Visual confrontation naming: BNT, impaired (47/60).
- Verbal fluency: Animals (raw = 16), below expectations; FAS (raw = 45), wnl.

### Visuospatial Functions 

No deficits detected.

- Mental integration of visual stimuli: Visual Puzzles, wnl (ss = 12).
- Block construction: Block Design, wnl (ss = 11).
- Line drawing construction: Paper-and-pencil construction of a complex figure was wnl (35/36). Organized approach; figure contained all elements.

### Learning and Memory 

Although there were no gross deficits, there was a general pattern of stronger nonverbal memory than verbal memory ability. She particularly struggled with recalling more complex verbal information that was provided after a single learning trial.

#### Verbal 
- Noncontextual: AVLT Total, low average (z = –0.9); Trial VIII, wnl (12/15); intact recognition (15 hits; 0 FPs).
- Contextual: Story IR, low average (ss = 6); story DR, low average (ss = 7); intact recognition (25/30). When compared to a more similar demographic peer group, performance was below expectations (LMI and LMII DemT = 35).

#### Nonverbal

- Passive learning of progressively more complex figures: VR I, wnl (ss = 11); VR II, wnl (ss = 10). Recognized 7/7 designs.
- Active learning: Complex figure delayed recall, wnl (18/36). Perseveration of features.

### Mood/Self-Report

Significant affective distress was denied on self-report measures.
- Depression: Minimal symptoms (BDI-II = 6).
- Anxiety: Mild (BAI = 8).
- MMPI-2-RF. 
	- Validity: Profile is considered valid.
	- Clinical: No clinically significant elevations.

## Summary and Formulation 

XXXX is a 28-year-old left-handed female with a history of medically refractory epilepsy who was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive presurgical work-up. General cognitive ability is well within normal limits, and there is no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates. No deficits were detected in the domains of attention, processing speed, motor functioning, or visuospatial skills. Although many aspects of executive functioning, language functioning, and memory were within normal limits, she demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and hypothesis testing, weaknesses in word retrieval, and inefficiency in new learning of verbal information. There is no evidence of a mood disorder at this time.

In conclusion, the cognitive profile is mildly localizing and lateralizing as there are elements that suggest relative left temporal involvement. That said, there were features seen during testing that suggested mild frontal systems disruption as well.
Although Ms. XXXX lives alone, she has arranged to have her mother stay with her for a week or two after surgery to help her and provide support in the immediate postacute period. She seems to have a good understanding of and appropriate expectations for the surgery. Taken together with her current asymptomatic mood profile, there are no obvious psychological risk factors for a poor outcome or need for presurgical mental health intervention.
