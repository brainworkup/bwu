<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to academic achievement (reading, writing, math). For scores that are below average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are above average to below average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.

<<EXAMPLE>>

`r params$first_name`'s broad academic achievement and academic fluency skills fell in the Average range for `r params$his_her` age and grade-level. Math fluency, math calculation, and quantitative reasoning were Average to Exceptionally High. `r params$first_name` demonstrated Average written expression skills on measures of word spelling and expository writing, and Average writing speed/fluency. By contrast, there were statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences between `r params$first_name`'s predicted scores (based on `r params$his_her` cognitive ability) and the scores `r params$he_she` actually obtained on measures of reading achievement. While reading comprehension stood out as a strength, there were 21-25 point discrepancies between `r params$his_her` predicted and obtained scores on the Word Reading subtest and the Reading composite. These differences are significant and so large that they are not commonly found in the general population (2%-5%), indicating a notable personal weakness in reading decoding. A pattern of strengths and weakness (PSW) analysis indicated reduced working memory capacity contributes to `r params$first_name`'s low reading scores and very likely constrains learning.
