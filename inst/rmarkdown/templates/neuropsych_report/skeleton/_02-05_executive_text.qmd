<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to
attention and executive functioning. For scores that are Below Average, give a brief
example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning.
Organize your summary and interpretation from scores that are Above Average to
Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.

<<EXAMPLE>>

### Attentional Skills
- _Attention Index:_ Average; Biggie's general attentional
capacity is in line with typical expectations.
- _Auditory Attentional Capacity:_ High Average (9 digits forward). This indicates that Biggie has a strong ability to focus and maintain attention when receiving auditory information.
- _Efficiency in Selective Attention:_ Average; Biggie can focus on specific details and ignore irrelevant information at an average efficiency.
- _Scanning, Divided Attention, Cognitive Flexibility:_
Average; This signifies that Biggie can divide their attention among
multiple tasks, adapt to new information, and visually track moving objects to
an average degree (i.e., attentional fluency).
- _Divided Attention, Information Processing Speed, Inhibition:_ Average; This
indicates a typical capacity to multitask, process information, and control
impulses (i.e., attentional fluency).

### Working Memory
- _Working Memory for Orally Presented Information:_ High Average (7 digits
backward). Biggie can effectively retain and process spoken information in their
short-term memory. 
- _Maintenance and Resequencing of Verbal Information:_
Exceptionally High; This showcases a strong ability to hold onto and rearrange
sequences of numbers and letters in working memory.

### Processing Speed
- _Psychomotor Speed:_ Low Average; Biggie might be somewhat slower in
activities that require rapid and coordinated physical movements.
- _Efficiency of Psychomotor Speed, Visual Scanning Ability, and Visual-Motor Coordination:_ High Average; Biggie possesses good visual skills and hand-eye coordination which are important in activities like reading and fine motor tasks.

### Executive Skills
- _Executive Functions Index:_ Average; Across various executive
functions, Biggie's performance is consistent with normative expectations.
- _Strategic Planning and Organization:_ High Average; Biggie can plan and
organize actions well before executing them, reflecting an ability to anticipate
future events and needs.
- _Planning, Foresight, Inhibition, and Psychomotor Speed:_ Average; Biggie's ability
to plan ahead, inhibit impulses, and move with purpose and speed is typical.

<<START>>

Orientation to person, place, time, and situation was intact. No gross
behavioral apathy or disinhibition observed. Auditory attentional capacity was
Average (# digits forward). Working memory for orally presented information was
Average (# digits backward). Formal testing of an array of attention and
executive functions revealed heterogeneous skills. A composite index of both
basic and complex verbal and nonverbal attentional capacity/functioning was
Average. A composite index of higher executive skills was Average.
