## Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-11.jdk/Contents/Home")
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx16000m")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  root.dir = normalizePath("./"),
  echo = TRUE,
  message = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  error = TRUE
)
xfun::pkg_load2("pdftools", "tabulapdf", "vroom", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "rJava", "shiny")
library(hablar)
library(here)
library(rmarkdown)
library(rmdformats)
library(tibble)
library(rlang)
library(bwu)
```

## Patient

```{r patient}
patient <- params$patient
```

## Test

```{r test}
test <- params$test
```

## Test Name

```{r testname}
test_name <- params$test_name
```

## Path

It appears you're mixing up two tasks: creating a file path and reading/writing to a file.
The `here::here()` function is fantastic for creating paths that are relative to your project directory, ensuring reproducibility across different systems.

Let me break down the tasks and show you how to handle each:

### 1. Creating a File Path:

To create a file path using the `here::here()` function, you would do something like this:

```{r}
file_path <- here::here("pdf", "pai.pdf")
```

This creates a file path that joins your project directory, the value stored in `patient`, "pre_csv", and "pai.pdf".

### 3. Reading from a File:

The `readLines()` function reads text lines from a file.
The primary argument is the file path.
So, to read from the file we wrote to in the previous step, you'd do:

```{r}
read_content <- readLines(file_path)
```

Bringing it all together, using the two chunks you provided:

```{r write}
file_path <- here::here("pdf", "pai.pdf")
content <- "This is some sample content." # replace with your actual content
```

```{r read}
file_path <- here::here("pdf", "pai.pdf")
read_content <- readLines(file_path)
```

Remember to replace the placeholder content with your actual content.
Additionally, ensure that the `patient` object exists and has been properly defined before these chunks are executed.

## Upload/attach PDF

```{r file}
# file <- file.choose()
file <- file.path(params$file)
```

## Export PAI CSV file from PARiConnect

Need to export csv file from PARiConnect before processing.
"Export Client Data" tab, then click "Univ of Southern Cali" then "PAI".
Specify date range to exclude entire database.

## Import PAI CSV file from PARiConnect

Copy over to pre_csv.

```{r pluck}
plucked_table <-
  readr::read_csv(
    here::here("pre_csv", "pariconnectexportPAI.csv")
  )
```

## Clinical and validity scales

### Subset and rename columns

```{r subset}
df_clinical <- plucked_table |>
  dplyr::select(
    SOM_T:AGG_P_T, ALC_Est, DRG_Est
  ) |>
  tidyr::gather() |>
  dplyr::rename(scale = key, score = value)

df_validity <- plucked_table |>
  dplyr::select(
    ICN_T:PIM_T,
    MAL_T:HRI_T
  ) |>
  tidyr::gather() |>
  dplyr::rename(scale = key, score = value)

df_inatt <- plucked_table |>
  dplyr::select(IINATTN_T) |>
  tidyr::gather() |>
  dplyr::rename(scale = key, score = value)

adhd_items <- c(
  "R13",
  "R15",
  "R18",
  "R21",
  "R34",
  "R57",
  "R94",
  "R112",
  "R139",
  "R167",

  "R254",
  "R282",
  "R299",
  "R311",
  "R322",
  "R325"
)

df_adhd <- plucked_table |>
  dplyr::select(adhd_items) |>
  tidyr::gather() |>
  dplyr::rename(scale = key, score = value)
```

### Convert T scores to z scores to percentiles

```{r t2z2p}
df_clinical <- df_clinical |>
  dplyr::mutate(z = (score - 50) / 10) |>
  dplyr::mutate(percentile = trunc(pnorm(z) * 100)) |>
  dplyr::select(scale, score, percentile)

df_validity <- df_validity |>
  dplyr::mutate(z = (score - 50) / 10) |>
  dplyr::mutate(percentile = trunc(pnorm(z) * 100)) |>
  dplyr::select(scale, score, percentile)

df_inatt <- df_inatt |>
  dplyr::mutate(z = (score - 50) / 10) |>
  dplyr::mutate(percentile = trunc(pnorm(z) * 100)) |>
  dplyr::select(scale, score, percentile)
```
