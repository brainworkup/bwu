Biggie showed particularly strong performance on tests measuring working memory
capacity and higher cognitive reasoning, both of which ranked in the
Exceptionally High and Above Average ranges respectively. Other estimates of her
verbal and visual memory functioning, crystallized intelligence, language
comprehension, and premorbid verbal ability level all fell within the Above
Average range. These scores suggest that Biggie is highly versatile with regards
to her cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of working memory
capacity, higher cognitive reasoning, and verbal/visual memory functioning.
However, attentional function and aggregate performance across metrics of
processing speed and cognitive efficiency were categorized as Average. This may
pose challenges in her ability to concentrate on tasks, retain instructions, or
attend to intricate details. Relative deficiencies in these areas may suggest
difficulties in managing time-sensitive tasks or demonstrating self-discipline
in routine activities. Such factors could result in challenges when undertaking
complex work tasks necessitating efficient multitasking, as well as subtler
impairments such as difficulty staying focused during conversations.
