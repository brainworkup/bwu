<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these rating scales related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and executive functioning, for both the self-report measures and the Observer-Report measures. For scores that are below average or worse on the CEFI, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. For scores that are above average or higher on the CAARS, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation from scores that are above average to below average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.
