<<PROMPT>>

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to
sensorimotor functions (gross motor and fine motor). For scores that are Below
Average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that are
Above Average to Below Average to delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively.

<<EXAMPLE>>

All scores in this area were Average. Fine motor speed and dexterity were
Average bilaterally. No evidence of atypical lateralization of fine nor gross
motor skills. No evidence of dyspraxia. Graphomotor speed and accuracy (i.e.,
graphomotor control) was intact. Gross motor functioning including balance and
gait appeared intact on observation.
