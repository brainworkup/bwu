The goal of `bwu` is to facilitate neuropsychological evaluation data
processing, report writing, and presentation of results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `bwu` like so:

```{r echo = FALSE}
pak::pak("brainworkup/bwu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, echo = FALSE}
library(bwu)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

```{r dots}
summary(dots)
```
