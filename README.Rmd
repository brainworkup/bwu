# Neuropsychology Package npsych.data

The goal of npsych.data is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of npsych.data from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jtrampush/npsych.data")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(npsych.data)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can
include R chunks like so:

```{r dots}
summary(dots)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use
GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example
workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r dots-plot, echo = FALSE}
plot(dots$age, dots$normValue)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so
they display on GitHub and CRAN.
