The goal of bwu is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of brainworkupr like so:

```r
pak::pkg_install("brainworkup/bwu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bwu)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

```{r dots}
summary(dots)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
`devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push.
An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
