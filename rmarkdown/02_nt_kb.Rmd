## Behavioral Observations {#behavioral-observation .unnumbered}

### Testing {#testing .unnumbered}

Kol was seen in-person at the USC Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Services (PBHS) clinic on the University Park Campus.
He completed a 4-hour testing session in a physically distanced testing environment.
A number of precautionary safety measures were employed (e.g., masks, gloves, plexiglass dividers) to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection without interfering with testing.

Kol transitioned appropriately to begin testing. It was a pleasure to see him again, and easy to establish rapport with him. He was in a cheerful mood and motivated to do his best on testing. His language expression and comprehension were age-appropriate. Eye contact was good and appropriate to situation and setting. 
For paper-and-pencil tests, he used him right hand with variable pencil grip.

Relative to his previous evaluation, he evidenced fewer difficulties behaviorally with distractibility and restlessness. On exam, he also had difficulty balancing speed and accuracy while working on him own, and either rushed through tasks, or completed them at a more accurate but much slower pace; and he usually started working before I could finish the instructions.
He was always cooperative and responded to questions in a polite and forthright manner to the best of him abilities. 

Kol persisted even on challenging items and put forth good effort (as supported by formal effort measures). The evaluation in its entirety is an accurate representation of him functioning at this time, and the results presented herein are considered valid for interpretation.

### Child Interview {#child-interview .unnumbered}

Kol talked a lot about â€¦

### Intelligence {#iq .unnumbered}

Overall intellectual skills were *high average*.
Index scores were *average* to *high-average*, with strengths in verbal reasoning, working memory, and processing speed.
**Table** \@ref(tab:iq)

```{r wisc5, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "IQ data"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("02_NT", "kb", "kb_wisc5.png"), auto_pdf = TRUE)

```


### KTEA-3 Growth Scale Value Charts, Age Based Norms {#gsv .unnumbered}

Firstname's academic skills were at or below age-expected levels.
Site word reading and reading comprehension were average.
Nonsense word decoding was *average* when untimed yet *borderline* when timed (i.e., inefficient reading fluency).
Spelling was *borderline* and an area of relative weakness.
Math calculation skills were *average*.
**Table** \@ref(tab:academics)

An ability-achievement discrepancy analysis utilizing Firstname's FSIQ score of 117 as him intellectual benchmark indicated *broad reading* (14-points; base rate \<10%), *spelling* (25-points; base rate \<5%), and *reading fluency* (28-points; base rate \<2%) were statistically much lower than predicted. Discrepancy scores of this magnitude are indicative of *clinically significant* weaknesses in these academic areas because they occur so infrequently (i.e., the base rate) in 10-year-olds with similar educational backgrounds. 

### Verbal/Language {#verbal .unnumbered}

All scores in this area were *average* to *very-superior*.
An exception was in phonological processing, which was relatively weak across measures.
Phonemic word fluency was notable: Firstname's ability to generate as many words as possible in 1-minute in response to a letter cue was *abnormal* in and of itself, and even more impaired when contrasted with him exceptionally fast semantic fluency performance.
Phonological awareness is a skill that underlies reading development in early childhood, and him weakness in this area is consistent with him reading/spelling profile and history of difficulties in these areas.
**Table** \@ref(tab:verbal)

### Visual Perception/Construction {#spatial .unnumbered}

Scores were again *average* to *superior* here, without a clear pattern of strengths or weaknesses.
**Table** \@ref(tab:spatial)

### Attention/Executive {#executive .unnumbered}

Basic attention was intact.
Working memory and processing speed were *average* to *high-average*.
Concept formation/complex problem solving was an area of relative strength, falling in the *superior* range for him age.
Cognitive control/inhibition was *average* to *superior* with no notable deficits.
Mental flexibility/set-shifting was *average* across measures and perhaps an area of relative weakness.
Scores on timed tests varied, but tended to be a bit weaker than on untimed tests.
**Table** \@ref(tab:executive)

Of note, attention and executive functioning deficits may not show up on tests or in a structured testing office and yet be evident in real-world settings.
This seems to be the case for Kol, as parent ratings indicated significant attention and executive problems, even with medication. Firstname's own ratings indicated moderate concerns with him attention problems and hyperactivity/impulsivity.

### Memory {#memory .unnumbered}

Learning and recall of associated verbal-visual information (names of children shown in a series of pictures) was *average* overall, and Kol showed a nice learning curve.
Recall of the names after a brief delay was *average*.
Recall of complex verbal information (short stories) was *very-superior* for both free and cued recall.
Recall of complex visual material (multiple abstract designs) was *high-average* for immediate recall and *average* for delayed recall.
He was better at learning spatial locations than specific content. **Table** \@ref(tab:memory)

### Motor {#motor .unnumbered}

Fine motor speed and dexterity were *average* for both Firstname's dominant right hand and him left hand.
Pencil grip was variable.
Finger dexterity was better in him nondominant left hand compared to him right hand, which is an atypical pattern, yet is consistently seen in children with language-based learning disorders.
Complex motor sequencing/programming was easier for Kol than simple repeated tapping, suggesting he was more engaged during the more challenging task.
**Table** \@ref(tab:motor)

### Emotional/Behavioral/Adaptive {#emot-behav-adapt .unnumbered}

In addition to the attention and executive concerns noted above, parent ratings indicated difficulties with externalizing behavior, hyperactivity, depression, attention problems, atypicality, adaptability, and activities of daily living, as well as mild-to-moderate concerns with internalizing problems, adaptive skills, aggression, conduct problems, and functional communication.
Firstname's mother reports that Kol has a tendency to become irritable quickly and has difficulty maintaining him self-control when faced with adversity.
He has a tendency to become easily upset, frustrated, and/or angered in response to environmental changes; and has difficulty controlling and maintaining him behavior and mood. Of note, Amy Suddleson clarified him ratings on some of these scales during our feedback appointment. He felt as though these behaviors were more "state-like" than "trait-like" based on how Kol had been behaving recently and at the time he completed the measures. He said they are less severe than indicated (although still can be problematic). 
**Table** \@ref(tab:basc3-prs-child)

On self-report, Kol indicated the above noted concerns with ADHD-related behaviors, as well as mild-to-moderate concerns with school, sense of inadequacy/low self-esteem, and low self-reliance.
Kol reports that he dislikes school once in a while and sometimes wishes to be elsewhere, and noted sometimes being dissatisfied with him ability to perform a variety of tasks even when putting forth substantial effort.
He reports having difficulty maintaining necessary levels of attention and engaging in a number of restless and disruptive behaviors.
This is all affecting him self-esteem, as he reports a lower self-image than others him age, and having a low confidence level in him ability to make decisions, solve problems, and/or be dependable, when compared to others him age.

### **Figure** \@ref(fig:domain-plot). Broad Domain Scores {#domain-plot .unnumbered .page-break-before}

(ref:domain-plot) Firstname's test scores averaged across broad neurocognitive domains and converted to *z* scores for uniformity. Note that a *z* score of zero (0) falls at the 50th percentile on national norms relative to children who are the same age and grade level.

```{r domain-plot, fig.cap = '(ref:domain-plot)'}

## Make table
domain <- neurocog %>%
  filter(!is.na(domain)) %>%
  group_by(domain) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    n_timed = mean(timed),
    score_mean = mean(score),
    score_sd = sd(score),
    z_mean = mean(z),
    z_sd = sd(z),
    percentile_mean = mean(percentile),
    percentile_sd = sd(percentile),
    .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(n_freq = n / sum(n), n_pct = round((n_freq*100), 0))

### **Figure** \@ref(fig:subdomain-plot). Neurocognitive Strengths and Weaknesses {#subdomain-plot .unnumbered .page-break-before}

(ref:subdomain-plot) Firstname's low academic scores were driven by specific processing weaknesses in *phonological awareness and decoding*, *reading fluency*, and *word spelling*.

```{r subdomain-plot, fig.cap = '(ref:subdomain-plot)'}

## Make table
subdomain <- neurocog %>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_sub_domain)) %>%
  group_by(sub_sub_domain) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    n_timed = mean(timed),
    score_mean = mean(score),
    score_sd = sd(score),
    z_mean = mean(z),
    z_sd = sd(z),
    percentile_mean = mean(percentile),
    percentile_sd = sd(percentile),
    .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(n_freq = n / sum(n), n_pct = round((n_freq*100), 0))

## Plot result
subdomain_plot <-
  ggplot(subdomain,
         aes(x = z_mean, 
         y = reorder(sub_sub_domain, z_mean))) +

  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  # Set the entire chart region to a light gray color
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white")) +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "white"))
