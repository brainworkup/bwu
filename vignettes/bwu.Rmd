# Introduction

This is my personal package.
It contains some handy functions that I find useful for my projects.

# Colours

Sometimes you want to generate shades of a colour.
The `make_shades()` function makes this easy!

```{r}
shades <- make_shades("goldenrod", 5)
```

If you want to see what the shades look like you can plot them using `plot_colors()`.

```{r}
plot_colors(shades)
```

This function is also useful for viewing any other palettes.

```{r}
plot_colors(rainbow(5))
```
