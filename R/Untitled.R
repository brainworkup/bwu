cat("Diagnostically, `r params$fname`'s psychosocial and academic history is consistent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Her behavioral presentation and neuropsychological profile are consistent with this diagnosis, as testing variability was primarily related to her deficits in executive functioning: despite her notable intellectual strengths and best intentions, sustaining attention task after task was especially effortful for `r params$fname` throughout this assessment. `r params$fname` also tends to become internally distracted by her own thoughts, and her worries and overthinking use up a lot of her “mental energy.” She described having a vivid imagination and making far-reaching associations between unrelated events. This can leave her looking inattentive, forgetful, or unmotivated at times. Although it might not seem obvious, attention is a basic function underlying most, if not all, domains of neurocognitive and academic functioning; and executive functions orchestrate the ways in which a child's intellectual strengths and weaknesses are either utilized or compensated for (respectively) in everyday life. If someone has limited attention/executive skills (e.g., an inability to sustain or divide attentional focus, or a reduced ability to selectively attend to competing stimuli or ignore distracting stimuli), they will struggle to interact with the environment to an adequate degree and, thus have limited functioning in almost all other areas. The challenges she has been experiencing at school and at home are most likely related to executive difficulties and her internal reactions to heightened levels of perceived stress/anxiety vs. an emerging mood disorder. She hasn’t yet developed the “top-down” cognitive control tools she needs to manage her feelings and emotions consistently and its impinging upon her self-management skills.")
